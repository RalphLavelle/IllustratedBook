Together they set off south on a twelve-day trek over the C&#xE9;vennes mountains, land that nowadays lies in the Parc National des C&#xE9;vennes. With his sheepskin-lined sleeping bag piled on top of her, Stevenson coaxed Modestine over the terrain with liberal use of an <em>aiguillon</em>, a pointy French stick, hastily fashioned by a local who took pity on his tribulations with the stubborn beast. As the valleys echoed to his cries of <em>Prout!</em>, &#x201C;the masonic word of ass-drivers&#x201D;, he worked Modestine up embankments dense with chestnut-trees, down scree-slippy slopes, all along the gorges of the Loire and the Allier, and finally, the Tarn.</p>","<p>Little by little, Stevenson adapted to Modestine&#x2019;s unhurried <em>allure</em>, the seductive French word for &#x2018;pace&#x2019;. Availing of whatever <em>auberges</em> they came across along the way, including a monastery, where his rational presbyterian attitude to matters godly earned him a scolding from some of the denizens, they made slow and steady progress. At the end of a long day&#x2019;s journey, when banging on doors and shouting through windows got them no answer from the naturally reclusive villagers, nights were often spent <em>&#xE0; la belle &#xE9;toile</em>. Their peregrinations ended after two weeks in the village of Saint-Jean-du-Gard, where Stevenson, with some regret, but only some, struck a deal with a local merchant and he and Modestine parted ways.</p>","<p>I came across <em>Travels with a Donkey in the C&#xE9;vennes</em> in the tourist office - housed nowadays in L&#x2019;horloge, the medieval clock tower - of the village of Meyrueis, about fifty kilometres, as the vulture flies, west of Saint-Jean-du-Gard. We - me, my wife Athina, and our two boys, Alexander and Eoin - were there as part of a week-long trip organised by an Irish Traditional Music and Culture group we&#x2019;d joined in Dublin. We were in Dublin because I&#x2019;m from there, my Mum lives there, and we were halfway through a nineteen-month-long trip back to Europe from our home in Brisbane, Australia.</p>","<p>Reading Stevenson&#x2019;s travel memoir back in Mum&#x2019;s the following week, just for fun I imagined Athina as the protagonist of our own Stevenson-and-Modestine adventure:</p>","<p><em>In the year of 2015, in the town of Brisbane in southeastern Queensland, the then none-of-your-business-how-old-she-is Athina Lavelle bought one-way tickets to Vienna for her family and called it quits on her librarian job. Together with her husband and two boys she set off on a trek around Europe, somewhere Ralph called home, being Irish, and somewhere she did too, at least genetically, since her parents had left the Greek island of Zakynthos in the &#x2018;50s for Australia. With liberal use of a Rough Guide to Whatever Historical Town or Region She Happened To Find Herself In, she coaxed her husband and two boys into trains and buses and out of bookshops and Lego shops with liberal use of pleading, begging, and scolding. As the cobbled laneways off Europe&#x2019;s Stadtpl&#xE4;tze, piazze and plazas echoed to her cries of &#x201C;Alexander! Eoin! Come ON!&#x201D; she worked the stubborn beasts through the wintry hinterlands of the Danube, the Vistula, the Suck, and finally, the Arno.</em></p>","<p><em>Little by little, Athina adapted to the unhurried pace of a pair of schoolboys who must on occasion have wondered why they were sitting on a bench on a cold, windy train platform in Budapest or Bratislava instead of at their usual school desks in humid Queensland. Availing of whatever hosts they could find on the Couchsurfing and Help Exchange websites, including a sardonic and hyperactive Polish schoolteacher and his family, who took them camping in the lake district of Pomerania, they made excellent progress towards their next destination, whatever that turned out to be. At the end of the first golden summer they migrated to Dublin for the winter whereupon the magic abruptly ended for Ralph as he banged on the doors and shouted through the windows of the capital&#x2019;s reclusive recruitment agents.</em></p>","<p><em>Their odyssey ended after a year-and-a-half in the very bellybutton of Europe (well, one hundred-odd kilometres away from the navel of the ancient world, Delphi, but come on, close enough!), the Acropolis of Athens, the sacred City on the Hill dedicated to the goddess Athena, at which point our Athina, with some regret - plenty of it, actually - and her family struck a deal with Etihad Airways and they and Europe parted ways.</em></p>","<p>Stephenson expressed his wanderlust in this way:</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>For my part, I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel&#x2019;s sake. The great affair is to move; to feel the needs and hitches of our life more clearly; to come down off this feather-bed of civilization, and find the globe granite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints.</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>I wonder if he&#x2019;d still have called travel &#x2018;the great affair&#x2019; if he&#x2019;d had Alexander and Eoin along with him. Ah, they weren&#x2019;t so bad - I shouldn&#x2019;t complain. We were a bit old for nightclubs and beach raves and furthermore believed, with no evidence whatsoever, that travelling as a family would expose us to greater opportunities than we&#x2019;d otherwise have, without kids. But thinking of the many excellent reasons we&#x2019;d had to launch ourselves on such a big trip, I realised that none of them were that travelling would be &#x2018;an amazing experience for the kids&#x2019;, which you often hear people say. Kids hate travel. Alexander and Eoin (pronounced &#x2018;Owen&#x2019; by the way) would just as soon be left alone in their rooms with their Magic the Gathering and Lego games than fly to Vienna, via Doha, via Melbourne, from Brisbane, just so they could hang out with Austrian kids with funny accents and their Mum and Dad could look at some boring paintings and buildings. They&#x2019;d thank us in the future, when they were into boring paintings and buildings.</p>","<p>Another writer I&#x2019;d been reading on my travels was Homer, the Greek poet. A good two-and-a-half thousand years ago he told a story, a travel story, in his epic poem the <em>Odyssey</em>. It&#x2019;s about a man, a short man by all accounts, with a destination to reach: his home, on the Greek island of Ithaka. His wife, son, and dog are waiting there for him. There are plenty of satisfying (for the reader) obstacles for him to overcome before he can reach them. It&#x2019;s a saltier tale than <em>Travels with a Donkey</em>, and involves fewer asses. In a flagrant act of self-aggrandizement, I began to enumerate the many similarities between the Greek road warrior&#x2019;s trip and our own. The years of captivity &#x2013; his in the clutches of Calypso, ours in offices, in the clutches of a mortgage. Like Homer&#x2019;s hero, Ulysses, we also had an Athina to protect us. And we had a Greek island to get to by journey&#x2019;s end. Joking aside, the story of Ulysses is a story about going home and I was coming home too, if only temporarily.</p>","<p>There was one other thing in particular that struck me: Ulysses meets plenty of people (granted, some are deities, but the point stands) along the way. In fact, you could say his very journey is defined by the gods and cyclopses, kings and enchantresses, and minstrels and sirens he meets, not just by the places he sees. It&#x2019;s said that pirates take to sea looking for treasure, ignorant of the real treasure: the people they meet along the way. Personally, I think that whoever came up with that one might have misjudged the motives of your average buccaneer. Nevertheless, before setting out on this trip we&#x2019;d vowed to look for the gold as we went along, not just when we reached El Dorado. Because of course you never reach El Dorado.</p>","<p>We&#x2019;d managed to do a small amount of travel with the kids over the years but, increasingly, the manner of that travel wasn&#x2019;t doing it for us anymore. Staying in a hotel, B&amp;B, guesthouse, or villa is an excellent way to only meet people like ourselves. Leading up to our big trip we&#x2019;d begun to think of ways we might travel a bit differently. To be a bit more involved with the places we were staying in. Not too much, mind - we weren&#x2019;t adventurers after all, just parents and tourists: we knew our place. But if we could meet more of the people who lived in the places we&#x2019;d otherwise pass through like ghosts, by staying with them, if possible, then that would be adventure enough for us. We were aiming for less paid accommodation, and more chancing our arm seeing how much we could stay with locals for free. Well, free, but with a little work from us.</p>","<p>And there&#x2019;d be less Airbnbing on our travels. The difference between staying in an Airbnb, the trendy new way to travel, and a common-or-garden guesthouse or B&amp;B, was disappearing quickly, it seemed to us, as whole cities moved back in with their parents for the summer, or worse, bought flats just to rent, leaving empty units, and indeed whole empty <em>barrios</em>, in the middle of cities. We&#x2019;d stayed in dead-space Airbnbs on previous trips that paid lip service to the idea of the &#x2018;sharing economy&#x2019; but which were just a couple of empty rooms with no story to tell, each the same as the last, and no local person sharing time with us. On the other hand, we&#x2019;d also been in traditional, family-run guesthouses where we got to spend time with the people who owned them, so there was no clear-cut distinction to us between Airbnbs and regular guesthouses and B&amp;Bs. We weren&#x2019;t ruling out Airbnbs entirely, because there is still something magic about renting a living, temporarily vacated room, with all its posters, books, and knick-knacks, in an unfamiliar city.</p>","<p>We started browsing a website called Help Exchange for hosts with whom we could embed ourselves in return for doing housework, garden chores, language lessons, and in general, being dogsbodies. To prepare for our trip, we took in our own helpers. We wanted to experience the work exchange culture from the other end first. Plus, we needed help getting our own house in order. Our first helper was a young woman from Saxony, Germany, who helped us tidy up the place and brush up on our German. A young Catalan couple from Barcelona gave the place a lick of paint and hacked away at the bamboo that was taking over our garden. Finally, to help shift the boxes into the flat and brush up on our French while we were at it, we hosted a couple from Toulouse.</p>","<p>The way we planned to get around on this trip was so different from the way we normally travelled that I wouldn&#x2019;t even call some of it &#x2018;travel&#x2019;. Then again, <em>A Year in Provence</em> is classified as a travel book, and people seem to accept it as such, but Peter Mayle hardly ever goes anywhere in it, so maybe travelling has more to do with one&#x2019;s state of mind than a tally of how many places one goes to. If I had to pick two words that epitomised our new attitude to travel, they&#x2019;d be &#x2018;work&#x2019;, and &#x2018;people&#x2019;. Travel is hard work; in fact the French for work, <em>travail</em>, is where the word &#x2018;travel&#x2019; comes from. As we planned it over Christmas in Australia, we knew it&#x2019;d be hard yakka, as they say down under. But we were tired of the old way. We wanted to learn a new one, if necessary the hard way. To upend the feather beds of our lives - that would be a great affair. We were prepared to load someone else&#x2019;s dishwasher for a change and to be told off for doing it the wrong way, if necessary. As long as we weren&#x2019;t staying in a hotel or somewhere where no-one knew us and no-one cared about our journey.</p>","<p>Our affair started smack bang in the middle of Europe, and would take us to some countries familiar to us from previous trips and some new to us. On the first of March we flew from Brisbane to Doha, Qatar. From there we flew to Vienna. En route I came up with our new family motto: the people you meet are the travels you do.</p>"]]},{"index":1,"title":"Hausfeldstraße, Donaustadt","pages":[["<p><em>Dear Athina and Ralph, Thank you very much for your message. Actually you are the first helpXer family asking and we would love to host you. When in March are you planning to come and how long would you like to stay? Will it be for a holiday or are you a home/travel-schooling family? Unfortunately we won&#x2019;t have Holidays in March. That means that our kids have to go to school. Apart from that they are very active in various groups and take lessons (sports, Scouts, acting, music &#x2026;). That means, that they won&#x2019;t have a lot of time to spend with your kids. At least the weekends should be fine. I am looking forward to your reply. Have a good time, Sarah.</em></p>","<p>Sarah met us at Alpernstra&#xDF;e station, which is north-east of Vienna, in a suburb - a city, actually - called Donaustadt. Donaustadt, which means <em>Danube City</em>, is on the right-hand side (or the left bank, if you want to make it sound more artistic) of the Danube, mapwise, directly opposite Vienna itself. On the way from the airport I&#x2019;d noticed we&#x2019;d passed by Praterstern, the place with the fun park where Holly Martens finally meets Harry Lime, <em>The Third Man</em> himself, before they share a ride on the famous Ferris wheel and have their famous, chilling conversation, which thrilled me so much as a teenager, about cuckoo clocks and the renaissance.</p>","<p>Despite the jacket and hood she was wearing Sarah was easily identifiable from the profile picture on the Help Exchange website, and her English was as good as she&#x2019;d said. Most importantly, she was friendly. We needed to see a friendly face, a face reassuring us we&#x2019;d made the right decision about all this. She got us onto a bus which whisked us off into the drizzle in the direction of her home, which is where we&#x2019;d be spending the next three and a half weeks.</p>","<p>We got out of the bus a few minutes later opposite a ploughed field. It was still raining, and she walked us a few streets, past some nice-looking houses, into an estate of immense drabness made up of pebble-dashed townhouse rows, with maybe ten or fifteen houses to a row. Each house had its own mini-garden out front with which the residents could express themselves, with flowers, a gnome, some kids&#x2019; stuff, etc. But the houses themselves were all the same.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Here we are,&#x201D; she said, in front of the fourth row in (maybe), sixth house along (I think). We went in, shook off our wet gear, set down all our suitcases and backpacks, and met Hans, her husband, and their kids Philippe, 13, and Mara, 11. Hans was white-haired and ruddy-faced. A little older than me, I guessed. He was drinking a coffee when we arrived and reckoned he quaffed about two and a half litres every day. Austrians drink gallons of the brown stuff, I&#x2019;d read.</p>","<p>&#x201C;The coffee that could keep me up hasn&#x2019;t been invented yet,&#x201D; he announced, offering me some.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh, they&#x2019;ve invented the coffee that can keep me up, alright,&#x201D; I said.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>A&#xEF;e, a&#xEF;e, a&#xEF;e</em>.&#x201D; Hans said that a lot. He worked as a civil engineer in the Schottenring U-Bahn, a station we&#x2019;d soon get to know as the deep one, the one where we had to go down and down, several levels, just to get to the trains.</p>","<p>Sarah came from Vorarlberg, at the edge of the panhandle of Austria, if you can imagine Austria being Oklahoma-shaped and having the same terminology applied to its outline. Both of them spoke excellent, nigh-on perfect English, although, as I&#x2019;d find out over the next three-and-a-half weeks, Hans tended to overdo it with the imperfect case in situations where he really ought to have used the perfect. As in: &#x201C;I have read yesterday that [x]&#x201D;. I was never brave enough to correct him, and it wasn&#x2019;t my job to do so. My job, from what I remembered from our communication with Sarah, was to help Philippe and Mara with their English and French. Being reasonably good with languages was going to get me out of some of the more menial chores, which would fall to those not conversant in French. Tina, for instance. Mara had long blond hair and spoke good English, even if she had to regularly be prompted to do so by Hans, and Philippe seemed friendly and well-behaved. Unlike my own, these kids might actually be a pleasure to work with, I thought. If they spoke French better than me, however, the gig was up.</p>","<p>We were shown the basement, which is where we&#x2019;d be staying. There were cupboards full of soup cans and bread sticks, carrots and beans; whole plastic bins full of turnips and cabbages. Were they stocking up for the Vegetarian Apocalypse? It worried me that there was a lot more emergency food in the basement than there should have been. As if this was a country and a town under siege, rather than one of the more prosperous corners of the globe. Since Sarah was both the cook of the house, and a vegetarian, we realised then that if we wanted meat this month we&#x2019;d probably have to hunt it down ourselves.</p>","<p>That basement, eight and a half kilometres from Steffl, as Stephansdom, by general consensus the centre of Vienna, is known, would be our home for practically the first month of our big trip. We were exchanging a house on a quarter-acre of land, the Australian dream, one with a dense stand of Buddha&#x2019;s Belly bamboo, darting, blue-tongued skinks, an occasional tree snake, and a stately, crimson-flowering Poinciana tree, all at the foot of Mount Gravatt in the southeastern outskirts of Brisbane city, for the basement of an unprepossessing, pebble-dashed, terraced townhouse with a postage stamp garden in Danube City, in the northwestern outskirts of Vienna. We&#x2019;d have to do four hours of work per day, five days a week, in return for food and accommodation. Despite the mediocrity of our immediate setting, it still seemed too good to be true that we could just come to Vienna - okay, Donaustadt - the way we&#x2019;d done. Lying on my basement bed, trying not to be rude and fall asleep, my tired eyes fell on a framed picture on the sideboard table of a much younger Hans, blonde, somewhere in Africa, standing with two young black women who were more or less naked, and had grossly distended lip ornamentation and necks like giraffes.</p>","<hr>","<p>Waking up on the first morning of his trip, Robert Louis Stephenson compared his plight to Ulysses, who he claims was never as pleasantly blown off course than he - Stephenson - was, &#x201C;on waking he knew not where.&#x201D; Well, we knew where we were, but not what we&#x2019;d be doing. Sarah, however, had kindly told us to take it easy today. We could start the next day.</p>","<p>After they&#x2019;d left for school and work we explored our new habitat. There were whole shelves in our basement, obscuring entire walls, groaning under the weight of travel (Hans&#x2019;s) literature. Naturally enough, there was a lot of snow apparel down there too. That&#x2019;s what Austrians have where we&#x2019;d have our beach stuff at home; boogie boards, snorkelling masks, etc. On Sundays we drive down from Brisbane to Surfer&#x2019;s Paradise; here they go to the pre-Alps. Alexander and Eoin had never seen snow in their lives, so one thing we hoped to do at some stage was to redress that minor tragedy. To ease them into snow, however, today they&#x2019;d get ice.</p>","<p>On the western extremity of the <em>stadtzentrum</em> (city centre), in front of the gothic Rathausplatz, a huge ice rink full of pagan Wieners were celebrating the end of winter, all enacting a seasonal dance wearing pink and blue ritual garments and red helmets. The sun shone and the sky was blue. People sat around, still with their skates on, drinking beer and eating Germknodel outside makeshift Almh&#xFC;tte, as if they were up an Alp. The Sp&#xE4;tzle &amp; Burger huts looked good, and smelled better, but alas, we&#x2019;d sensibly made sandwiches. With the help of stabilising penguins Alexander and Eoin did their first ever bit of ice skating. Tina and I watched them and took photos, dancing on the spot just to stay warm. Such a quintessentially Austrian activity, ice skating. Our trip was off to a precociously splendid start.</p>","<p>We crossed the Ringstra&#xDF;e into the old city after the boys had skated their fill, and walked to the Hofburg, outside which we saw a fine, chunky statue of Prinz Eugens on a horse. Exhaling clouds of steam, at Michaelerplatz we peered into the ground at the excavated Roman walls, clapping our hands and stamping our feet. It excited me to think about the Roman (and Greek) antiquities we&#x2019;d see over the next year. It&#x2019;s amazing how excited one gets, living in Australia, over a bunch of old bricks in a hole in the ground anywhere in Europe.</p>","<p>Near Steffl we found the atmospheric Caf&#xE9; Hawelka, going strong since the end of World War II, apparently. Again I thought of <em>The Third Man</em>. Vienna as film noir backdrop. We downed a couple of m&#xE9;langes, wrestling with newspapers bound to large sticks, obviously some anti-pilfering mechanism. A most unsatisfactory arrangement, I thought, giving up trying to read something I couldn&#x2019;t understand anyway, and started going through the dozens of photos I&#x2019;d already taken with our new digital compact camera, bought especially for the trip.</p>"],["<p>Within a few days, we&#x2019;d hit our groove. Being the earliest riser in our gang, I&#x2019;d make an appearance upstairs before Sarah left for work (the others would already have gone) to find out what our duties were for the day. Despite the bitter winter cold, she liked to open the windows up first thing to freshen up the place. Then she&#x2019;d leave, and my first duty was always to close them again. Craziness. Considering how much the cold was affecting me, but not her, nor, weirdly, the boys, who I&#x2019;d expected to make much more of a fuss than they did, I began to wonder if I wasn&#x2019;t somehow misinterpreting the temperature, as if my body had forgotten to do a Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion, or something. I checked. It wasn&#x2019;t that. Austria uses Celsius, just like we do in Australia.</p>","<p>All houses have their foibles, and we had to learn this one&#x2019;s quickly. For instance, you had to go at the door of the washing machine with a screwdriver, like a housebreaker, just to open it. Also, the ordeal of undressing and dashing through the cold air into the shower was usually rewarded with little more a stingy trickle from the shower head. Showers often have something wrong with them, in my experience, and like snowflakes or unhappy families, no two are the same. Moving upstairs now, the fridge, if left to its own devices, refused to close properly and had to be given a gentle push, if you remembered, whereupon it sighed, and gave in. Stuff like that.</p>","<p>The chores we were given were straightforward enough, though, except for the times we got them wrong. Doubtless distracted by our plan to go to the State Opera House that afternoon, Tina one morning early in our stay hung out a basketful of our hosts&#x2019; laundry on an indoor folding clothes rack one day - dirty laundry, it turned out. Socks, jock, knickers, and bras.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Not to worry,&#x201D; Sarah said when she noticed, &#x201C;we always put our dirty laundry there. So now you know, ha ha.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, sorry about that, ha ha,&#x201D; Tina laughed nervously. &#x201C;Won&#x2019;t happen again!&#x201D;</p>","<p>I hung out their dirty socks, jock, knickers, and bras the very next day. Hung it all out to dry, as if it was clean and fresh and in need of hanging out to dry after being washed. Only it hadn&#x2019;t been. Same basket, same time of day. I hadn&#x2019;t heard about Tina&#x2019;s mistake, nor Sarah&#x2019;s explanation. But other than dirty undie hiccups we slotted in quickly. We&#x2019;d arrive back from one of our daily excursions to the city to coincide with Philippe and Mara getting home from school. Neither Sarah nor Hans came home till after six most days, which left us in charge of the whole house. At the bottom of the stairs I&#x2019;d shout up to Philippe, several times on occasion, as if I was his Dad, to come down and start his homework. We were in charge of other peoples&#x2019; kids in those peoples&#x2019; house. I&#x2019;m not sure my writing skills are up to conveying just how strange that felt for us after just a few days in the country.</p>","<p>At night we&#x2019;d usually all eat together - &#x2018;cultural exchange&#x2019; was one of the pillars of the Help Exchange philosophy - and then, if we thought they were up for it, sit around the fire and chat. We had to get the measure of our hosts pretty quickly; learn to read them, get the temperature of the room, find out whether these people - strangers to us still, really - who had just done a day&#x2019;s work, were in the mood for company or just wanted to be left alone. They were usually up for a chat.</p>","<p>&#x201C;The European project is all about removing borders,&#x201D; Hans said with great stateliness one night, stoking up the living room fire with eco briquette heat logs, pale brown cylinders of a smoothness and regularity more befitting Lego than fuel. He held an Austrian touring map up in front of his face that he&#x2019;d dug out earlier to help us find walking routes in the woods.</p>","<p>&#x201C;This is the problem with borders,&#x201D; he said from behind the map. &#x201C;How can people be friends?&#x201D;</p>","<p>I wasn&#x2019;t sure about that one: I don&#x2019;t remember being friends with everyone in Ireland, and could easily imagine being friends with anyone who shared the same interests as me and was easy to get on with but who happened to live over a border from me. &#x201C;But if there are no borders then we can have a bottle of wine and be friends!&#x201D; For good measure he poured us all some red and plonked down on the couch. Sarah curled up with a blanket beside him. We had a notion to go walking in the woods soon. Any woods. It just seemed quite a Viennese thing to do. She told us the best place to get the bus to Heiligenstadt, a village on the wooded hill of Kahlenberg, a few kilometres north of the city. This naturally led to a discussion of how to get back home again from the village of Kahlenbergerdorf (bus, then U-Bahn), which in turn led to a discussion about the Greek debt crisis which was heating up once again. Half-heartedly apologising in deference to Tina&#x2019;s Greek sensibilities, Hans shook his head, and half-saying, half-sighing, said, or sighed, &#x201C;A&#xEF;e, a&#xEF;e, a&#xEF;e!&#x201D; Being a middle-aged man, he was wont to be exasperated at the state of the world.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ach, I do not understand how they can come back for more money with a smile,&#x201D; he said, referring to the Greeks. He wasn&#x2019;t so unsophisticated as to come out with the old trope about them not paying their taxes. No - as far as he was concerned it was much more serious than that. As an engineer, it was quite straightforward to him what the problem was. &#x201C;They do not have a system. You must have a system.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Normally I get quite defensive about Greece, being married to the mob as I am. But the truth was that Greece was in big trouble at that time. It seemed like every time the news came on, Tsipras (the Greek premier) was copping it from Merkel, or Hollande, or Tusk, or Cameron, or the Italian guy, or the Spanish. We&#x2019;d be there ourselves in a month and would be able to see then what all the fuss was about, but for the meantime it was interesting to hear the opinions of people in the suburbs of the capital cities of Europe.</p>","<p>To introduce a bit of levity into proceedings I steered the conversation to the fun subject of &#x2018;famous Austrians&#x2019;. Show Hans and Sarah how much we knew about their country. They were probably sick of hearing about Arnold Schwarzenegger, I thought, so, in a breathtakingly gauche stroke which still, at the time of writing, I&#x2019;m at a loss to explain, I thought that at that moment, sitting there by the fire with a glass of red in my hand, I&#x2019;d resurrect the ghost of former President of Austria, UN Secretary General, and erstwhile Wehrmacht Oberleutnant, - that&#x2019;s right - Kurt Waldheim, in these nice people&#x2019;s front room. Hans put his glass of red down and with a sigh politely but swiftly reburied the Oberleutnant, firmly packing the earth down. &#x201C;He was no different from everyone else. He was forced to join the Nazis. Everybody had to join them.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Suppose so. Right, well I&#x2019;m off to bed,&#x201D; I said.</p>","<hr>","<p>Unleashed on Europe with our new camera I set about photographing stuff with the years of a man half my age. I was like the guy in &#x2018;Blow-up&#x2019;, straddling the model - Europa! - while she gyrated in phoney ecstasy (although I never for a second thought Vienna was faking it. She wouldn&#x2019;t!) &#x201C;That&#x2019;s it. Work it, baby!&#x201D; I&#x2019;d say, broodily pacing around outside Karlskirche, the camera strap wrapped tightly around my wrist, hand clutching the apparatus like an eagle a mouse.</p>","<p>In every museum we went to we politely asked &#x201C;Can we take photos?&#x201D;, and they just as politely answered &#x201C;<em>Ja, aber ohne blitz.</em>&#x201D; The phrase &#x201C;<em>Ohne blitz</em>&#x201D; (&#x201C;no flash&#x201D;) became one of those phrases that stuck with us the entire time we were in Austria. Selfie sticks had, at that stage, already been banned in many museums and galleries in the States and Germany, and the Albertina in Vienna had recently had the good sense to make them verboten too. In Austria, a selfie-stick is called a <em>Teleskopstab f&#xFC;r das Handy</em>, or <em>Handy-Stab</em>, since they&#x2019;re handy for stabbing their owners with. </p>","<p>As well as their monumental architecture, I&#x2019;d been watching the Wieners themselves. They probably thought that as a tourist I was looking at the Hofburg Imperial Palace or Schloss Sch&#xF6;nbrunn, but I was looking at them. Oh yes. What&#x2019;s more, I snuck-took photographs of them surreptitiously. In my defense, if I didn&#x2019;t use subterfuge it wouldn&#x2019;t really be possible at all. <em>Es ist meine Lieblingsbesch&#xE4;ftigung</em>, my favorite activity. Sometimes I&#x2019;m only really in the zone with my camera when I&#x2019;m trying to photograph total strangers; people in the street, other tourists at the museum, or locals just sitting and minding their own business who find themselves in the same caf&#xE9; as me.</p>","<p>On Opernring one evening, on our way to the Naschmarkt, I went up and asked some of the robed-up ticket touts you see hanging around outside the Staatsoper could I take their photo. It&#x2019;s easy to approach people who are dressed up in some way. Especially if they&#x2019;re standing outside a world famous opera hall attracting attention to themselves, although in this case they seemed to be on a smoke break. Anyway, they were fine with it, although for some reason they didn&#x2019;t like the idea that I&#x2019;d be putting photos on Flickr. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t like social media.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Why not?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Anyone can see the picture.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the idea.&#x201D;</p>","<p>They gave me their card. &#x201C;Vienna Visitor Service&#x201D;. If I didn&#x2019;t know what they did and someone handed me their card I&#x2019;d think they were tourist prostitutes. They didn&#x2019;t really care about Flickr, or I wouldn&#x2019;t have persisted. You can tell when people are genuinely not into having their photos taken and when they&#x2019;re just messing with you. The unsmiling <em>Fiaker</em> guys outside Steffl, the guys in black with bowler hats lined up with their horses with green blankets and ear muffs and the pretty carriages, well, they were tougher nuts to crack.</p>","<p>Long ago, as part of a photography course I did in Dublin, we covered the legality of photographing people in public. Basically, it&#x2019;s game on for photographers. If you&#x2019;re in the street, even if you&#x2019;re minding your own business, you&#x2019;re mine. Not everyone understands that. I once got pulled over by a policeman in Paris for sneakily taking people&#x2019;s pictures as I walked by them. I didn&#x2019;t feel like getting into it with a <em>flic</em>, obviously, but I couldn&#x2019;t see what was so wrong. They&#x2019;re in public, in the street. How else can you get candid, documentary-type street scenes? Think of the sort of work that Doisneau and Cartier-Bresson did, the sort they sell as posters, the sort which strongly suggest that Paris is where you go to kiss photogenically on the Rue de Rivoli? Those old masters had their ruses (Cartier-Bresson covered up all the shiny surfaces of his Leica with black tape to make it inconspicuous). And that run-in with the Parisian policeman was over twenty years ago. Cameras are everywhere now, even on things that aren&#x2019;t cameras, like phones and tablets. And look up: you&#x2019;re probably being videoed from a lamppost as soon as you leave the house.</p>","<p>There are rules of engagement, however: thou shalt not misrepresent what&#x2019;s happening by cropping a vital part of the picture (another person, for example). Same with Photoshop alterations. I can&#x2019;t see why you&#x2019;d do that anyway if you&#x2019;re just a travel blogger or (would-be) writer like me documenting a place you visited. Also, try not to make people look bad. It&#x2019;s easy to get a dramatic expression on someone&#x2019;s face by waiting for them to yawn, or grimace, but it&#x2019;s not fair to make someone look silly; and again, it wouldn&#x2019;t be true to what they were doing, so abstain.</p>","<p>I took a picture of two women in one of the famous (and very pink) Aida caf&#xE9;s in the centre of town one morning. Completely destroyed during the war, the chain was rebuilt again later. They all have a &#x2018;70s feel, the caf&#xE9;s, and the waitresses (it only seems to be women who work there) all wear the same pink dresses (often with their slip showing, for some reason.) Anyway, one of the pair of women was really quite animated throughout the conversation, as animated as her companion was impassive. Not that there was any rancour between them, but I don&#x2019;t think the other woman said a single word. We tucked into our <em>einsp&#xE4;nners</em> and <em>Apfelstrudels</em> and I got a few shots. When she&#x2019;d gotten it all off her chest, the garrulous woman and her silent partner put their coats back on and went out into the cold. They hadn&#x2019;t noticed me at all. Or had, and didn&#x2019;t care.</p>","<p>And then there are the pictures you pay for. With cash, I mean, not karma. One Saturday night we ended up down at the famous Naschmarkt, traipsing around all peckish, tempted at every food stall of course, but unwilling to give in and blow the day&#x2019;s budget unless we saw something special. The trouble was we didn&#x2019;t know what we wanted. I didn&#x2019;t know enough about Austrian food to know which of these places was authentic and which a tourist trap. We were just teasing ourselves, and getting hungrier and more jaded by the minute. About to call it a night, we came across a tiny, homely Gasthof with what sounded like traditional Austrian music coming from inside. We looked in the window: quaint, cosy, and with a free table, to boot. To think I had seriously thought about the Thai joint we&#x2019;d passed two minutes earlier. With our bums on a pew, and our food on the way, we soaked up the music and the <em>Atmosph&#xE4;re</em>. I went around and got a few decent photos of the musicians, since of course these seasoned <em>Naschmarkt Gasthof Musiker</em> were ok with people taking photos. When they eventually took a break and went around with the cap, I was happy to chip in, knowing I&#x2019;d got my shot. It probably was a tourist trap. So what? I ordered <em>Fiakergulasch mit Spiegelei, W&#xFC;rstel, Gurkel, und Semmelkn&#xF6;del</em>, and photographed that too.</p>"],["<p>It was time for us to break out of the city and explore the woods around Vienna. There was no shortage of trees where we came from, of course, but they all seemed to be gum trees, (very) sporadically peopled with koalas, who, even if you did manage to glimpse one, were generally catatonic. As far as we were concerned, if a forest didn&#x2019;t entirely consist of eucalypts (gums) it would be, <em>ipso facto</em>, a forest worth seeing. So we took Sarah&#x2019;s advice and headed out to Heiligenstadt one morning.</p>","<p>At that time of the year if you weren&#x2019;t fully awake before you left the house you certainly would be by the time the scourging wind whipped through you on the way to Alpernstra&#xDF;e station. From there it took about twenty minutes to reach the city centre on the U-Bahn (the line we took was called U2, in homage, surely, to the Irish stadium-rockers), from where we&#x2019;d catch a bus to Heiligenstadt. On the train we usually browsed the free <em>Heute</em> commuter mag we&#x2019;d find outside the station, just to brush up on our German, although if you were lucky someone would have left a copy of <em>Der Standard</em> on a carriage seat. Fabulous in Financial Times pink, it&#x2019;s easily the best newspaper in Austria, according to its website: <em>&#x201E;Der online News-Room der f&#xFC;hrenden Qualit&#xE4;tszeitung (highest quality) in &#xD6;sterreich&#x201C;</em>.</p>","<p>At the end of the line on our Heiligenstadt bus we got out, obviously radiating disorientation and confusion, since ere we knew it an older man accosted us, stout of build and dapper in a double-breasted cream topcoat, complete with shoulder lapels, and asked if he could help us.</p>","<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re looking for the top of the hill. It must be around here somewhere.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Come. I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201D; Under a pale and watery sun, he led us the hundred yards or so to St. Josefskirche, a tall, white church with a copper-green fluted pyramid on top. A small plaza gave way to a terrace with a caf&#xE9; and a view over the plain below. Curling gently through that view was the river, of course, with Vienna itself south, on our right, and Donaustadt, on the other side, to our left. A few conspicuous skyscrapers - the cylindrical Milennium Tur, and the Donaustadt Tur - revealed just how low-built the old Vienna was.</p>","<p>&#x201C;We want to walk down to Kahlenbergdorf. We should be able to get the bus back to the city from down there.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s Kahlenbergdorf,&#x201D; he said, pointing out a riverside village down the hill whose church had the same green top as the one behind us. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t miss it.&#x201D; He was a friendly old soul, and he took a shine to Eoin. Unless it was your turn to tell him it was lights out and time for bedtime, at that age - he was seven then - Eoin had hit peak cute. Heightwise, he came up to halfway between his mother&#x2019;s elbow and shoulder, and he had a fetching new gap on the left-hand side of the top row of his teeth. The old gent, with his stylishly tucked in mauve scarf and great big bald egg of a head, was won over.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I think we can be friends, you and I, eh?&#x201D; he said, towering over Eoin.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ok.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I have been in my life an engineer, an artist, a soldier, a prisoner, a musician, a painter&#x2026;,&#x201D; he said, with one arm around Eoin, gazing down at him. &#x201C;Do you believe me?&#x201D;</p>","<p>Eoin smiled and nodded, looking at me. &#x201C;Ok.&#x201D;</p>","<p>We left the friendly old engineer/ex-prisoner and walked slowly downhill past fields full of ghostly vineyards, metre-high vines gnarled and crooked, locked in rows with fenceposts and wire. Below us was the river, split in two lanes by the DonauInsel, which peters out just north of there, and which was covered in wintry bare trees. Just above the village we stopped for sandwiches. The boys found an unattended ladder against a tree and took turns going up it and down again. There was no-one around. Not that there&#x2019;d been many tourists out at Sch&#xF6;nbrunn Palace when we&#x2019;d gone there a few days earlier, but here we were all alone, and it made a big difference. We were just having a walk in the countryside like people who lived around here might do.</p>","<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;d be nice to go into town now for a while. Find another famous coffee house.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Can&#x2019;t - I have to be back at four for English with Mara, remember?&#x201D; At this stage, after about one week, I regularly spent late afternoons up in Mara&#x2019;s room, helping her with her English. We had an essay to write together, using a list of twenty-five words she had to learn. &#x201C;Tomorrow. I promise.&#x201D;</p>","<p>We walked down the hill to Kahlenbergdorf, with its pink and white church with the green spout on top, and caught the bus back to the U-Bahn, which took us home.</p>","<hr>","<p><em>Stehplatzkarten</em> (standing passes) give people like us, visitors to the city on a budget, the means to experience the Musikverein, home to the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. The <em>Statsoper</em>, the grand, circular State Opera House, was out of our league in terms of queuing commitment (maybe two hours) and cost, whereas for the price of two <em>melanges</em> we could go to the Musikverein and enjoy some first class entertainment, if baroque chanting is your thing. Standing there (minus Alexander and Eoin) one weekday night at the back of the hall among the unwashed and unmoneyed, we were entertained first by the Arnold Schoenberg Choir, then by a baroque ensemble called Concentus Musicus Wien. </p>","<p>Being out for the night was exciting and all very nice, but in this case it involved a lot of standing. We&#x2019;d stick it out for a while, craning our necks to see around the other freeloaders down the back, before dropping out and sitting down on the carpet by the back wall to give our legs, back, and neck a rest, whereupon others would shuffle forward to take our place. We lasted until the interval, ninety long minutes, before deciding we&#x2019;d heard enough. In a bar around the corner, on K&#xE4;rntnerstra&#xDF;e, we had a Schremser and a wine and savoured the sensation of padded seats beneath our buttocks.</p>","<p>Coming from opposite ends of this continent (if you consider Tina Greek, which genetically she is), it was a stretch to say that the repertoire of the Concentus Musicus Wien was really part of our culture, that this was our common European heritage we&#x2019;d come so far to experience. It was never the habit of either of our sets of parents, God knows, to take us to classical music performances when we were growing up. But as the recipients of decent-enough educations we&#x2019;d developed an ear for a certain amount of classical music, enough to get us through the longeurs of (half of) tonight&#x2019;s performance. Any more would have been straining credibility. That culture - the difficulty of the music, the grey-haired socialites and aesthetes dressed to the nines - was exotic and familiar and strange to us, all at the same time.</p>","<p>Not only were Sarah and Hans feeding and hosting us, but that night they&#x2019;d been our babysitters too. She&#x2019;d warned us up front though that her kids might not have a lot of time for Alexander and Eoin, and Philippe&#x2019;s two years on Alexander meant that it was always going to be hard for our duo to appeal to the young teenager, but as we&#x2019;d found out on holidays in the past, computer games, normally every parent&#x2019;s nemesis, were powerful catalysts to social interaction for shy kids. Particularly Minecraft. So we&#x2019;d encouraged them to set up a server, which would mean they could all play together. That meant that they no longer even had to be in the same room, or floor, to play together. From their subterranean lair Alexander and Eoin could roam over a twilit mountainous world full of pigs, cows, zombies, chickens, creepers, spiders, skeletons, and sheep, while Philippe, upstairs in his bedroom, could stalk them in that same twilight. While Tina and I chatted with Hans Philippe had caught up with Alexander - virtually - and gone at him with a sword, while Eoin, unconcerned, was mining for diamonds. Hans, it turned out, had no time for that sort of virtual shenanigans and let Philippe know his opinion about Minecraft when he came down to say goodnight and innocently mentioned he&#x2019;d been playing with Al and Eoin. For our part, Tina and I had no qualms about the boys playing in the evening since, most days we&#x2019;d have walked their legs off on the boulevards or in the woods and they were more than entitled to a little of what they liked.</p>","<p>&#x201C;You know the way Sarah hates you playing jazz?&#x201D; I asked Hans. &#x201C;How you&#x2019;re not even allowed play it in the evening?&#x201D; Jazz was his church, but alas, Sarah had no time for the squally noodlings of junkie-blown saxophones. &#x201C;How would you like it if someone told you your culture was useless? Said everything you like is no good? This is what they like doing, and it makes them happy. They&#x2019;re playing with each other.&#x201D; I had just risked eviction comparing Miles to Minecraft.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>A&#xEF;e, a&#xEF;e, a&#xEF;e!</em>&#x201D;</p>"],["<p>Every time we took the U-Bahn from Sarah&#x2019;s into <em>Wien Stadtzentrum </em>we always glanced up reverentially to acknowledge our crossing of the Danube, which took place about five minutes into our journey. It was the old Danube we crossed first, <em>die Alte Donau</em>. You see, there are a few of them. To safeguard against its tendency to flood, for its transit of Vienna the Danube has been straightened out like a husband caught banging the au pair. I mean it&#x2019;s actually been straightened. The <em>Alte Donau</em> is the oxbow lake left over from this rectification. On top of this, and this is where my analogy with a love cheat collapses, a long pencil of an island, the Donauinsel, was planted, splitting the new river, the straight part that is, making two more bridges for us to cross. Nowadays the Donauinselfest (Danube Island Festival) is no less a thing than Europe&#x2019;s biggest open air event. Finally, there&#x2019;s the canal - stay with me - which is the Danube you see in the city centre, the place at graffiti-walled Schottenring where the cruise boats to Bratislava ply their trade. The four Danubes of Vienna. But what about the most famous of them all, the Blue Danube?</p>","<p>When the great river finally leaves Austria for Slovakia, bound ultimately for the Black Sea, it does so in an hour-long commute eastwards out of Vienna, but the real magic happens on the western side an hour before the capital. We rented a car on our first Friday and drove to <em>die Wachau</em>, a UNESCO World Heritage site to the west of Vienna. As if carved from the landscape by the timeless force of the Austrian tourism board, the stretch of the Danube Valley between Krems and Melk (&#x2018;cream and milk&#x2019;; well, it helps me remember them), is known as the blue Danube, from what I can gather.</p>","<p>It was still early in the morning when we got to Melk, whose Abbey, <em>Stift Melk, is </em>yellower even than Sch&#xF6;nbrunn Palace, which is saying something, and hulks over this small riparian town, a town where Benedictine monks endured a centuries-long orgy of dreariness, punctuated only by the thrill of prayer and occasional conflagrations. On our guided tour of the abbey we were surprised to learn about the startlingly modern innovation that one of the Habsburgs had come up with: a reusable coffin. The bottom panel opens like a bomb hatch as it&#x2019;s being lowered into the ground, releasing its cadaverous payload into the grave, freeing it up for the next Stift stiff. As well as recycling, there was more modernity to come, this time in the form of some special effects. The abbey&#x2019;s impressive Marble Hall, the <em>Marmorsaal</em>, has <em>trompe l&#x2019;oeil</em> frescos on the ceiling which deceive one into thinking the roof is higher than it actually is. It&#x2019;s an effective trick when you&#x2019;re standing in the middle of the hall looking straight up, but we noticed it breaks down at either end of the room, from which perspective the hall looks like it&#x2019;s had too much to drink. When it works, though, it really works, so we&#x2019;re thinking of getting it done in our front room at home, only with possums and kookaburras instead of the wrathful deities and fat, lolling cherubs of the <em>Marmorsaal</em>, which, to be honest, wouldn&#x2019;t really work in Australia. The tour ended with a visit to Stift Melk&#x2019;s Baroque church. They say you travel to discover yourself, and in so doing perchance to change. That cold March morning I changed indeed. I will never again associate abbeys with impecunity and asceticism. Not after experiencing the interior of that church. Rather, I will henceforth associate them with Liberace-level sumptuousness and a lot of gold.</p>","<p>Like Trajan&#x2019;s Bridge we crossed the Danube then, and entered the most scenic section of the Wachau. This is where the great river cleaves the wooded mountains, and inscribes a giant &#x2018;S&#x2019; on the landscape. At D&#xFC;rnstein we found ourselves in the backbone of the &#x2018;S&#x2019;. On top of the hill overlooking that town are the ruins of a castle called Kuenringerburg. It wasn&#x2019;t easy getting Alexander and Eoin (or indeed myself or Tina) out of the warm car and into the cold, but the reward, half an hour later, was an panoramic view of the river either side of the bend and the villages below us. This was why we&#x2019;d come to Austria; why we&#x2019;d come out to the Wachau today. I filled my lungs with mountain air, therapy indeed after a week of planes and cities. The clock on the pale blue and white tower of Stift D&#xFC;rnstein down below told us we still had a couple of hours of daylight left. On the other side of the river were laid out a couple of settlements, with up to a hundred pale-brown roofed houses, and here and there a church. The silence was total. The ruins up where we were were still intact enough to let you appreciate how miserable it must have been up there for Richard the Lionheart, betrayed in a nearby inn by his singing voice as he travelled incognito across the land, much as we were doing.</p>","<p>Further north, we crossed back over to the east bank at Krems, the northernmost reach of the Wachau before the Danube begins a more-or-less west-east course for fifty or so kilometres then turns south-east to run past the vineyards of Kahlenbergerdorf and its St. Josefskirche, splitting either side of the Donauinsel, and on down to Vienna. We had to chase the day&#x2019;s dying light and, in particular, to get to Schloss Sch&#xF6;nb&#xFC;hel, which we&#x2019;d seen earlier from across the river.</p>","<p>There was no question of having a tour of Sch&#xF6;nb&#xFC;hel: by the time we got there it looked shut up and dead. That was alright with me, since I was only interested in getting one photo, the one on the cover of our guidebook, taken from underneath a tree somewhere in the vicinity. Not that the wild foliage of the tree would even vaguely resemble the guidebook&#x2019;s photo at this time of the year. This time I had no story about Lionhearts to motivate the boys to get out of the warm car, other than my guarantee that this was the absolute final and last stop of the day, I promise.</p>","<p>At the foot of the castle ramparts was a scruffy shingle beach; waiting for the rest of them to catch up I threw a few sticks and stones into the river. There was nothing else to hear other than the sounds of the sticks falling into the water before drifting slowly away. Where would they end up? Bratislava? Budapest? The Black Sea? A few hundred yards downriver, most likely. The photographic sweet spot was around here somewhere, further along the bank, just a little further along, past the tall brown reed grass, while all the time the day was imperceptibly haemorrhaging precious light, light I needed to pick out the texture of the battlements and the browney-mauve roof tiles of Sch&#xF6;nb&#xFC;hel. Across the river, on the other side of the valley, the forested hills were gone, just one big undifferentiated mass against the stark blue winter (astronomically speaking) evening sky. The road we&#x2019;d driven north on a few hours earlier was barely visible anymore. I settled down on my haunches and took a few photographs, back along the bank. In the event, I ended up with a different kind of photo than the one I&#x2019;d wanted. In my photo, the rippled surface of the river, quiet, and barely moving, reflects the deep blue of the evening sky, flowing around a promontory upon which stands a castle nearly a thousand years old. In the foreground, walking along the bank, are two boys, hands deep in their pockets, hoods up, resentful at being made to talk a walk in the cold against their will.</p>"],["<p>Kneeling down in the mud in Hans&#x2019;s (he was the <em>gartenmeister</em> of the family) back garden, fingers numb, nose running, I considered the exchange rate we were getting for our daily chores. Just what does a hundred dandelions in a black plastic bucket get you in this town? After this, I had English with Mara. Today we&#x2019;d be covering the difference between the perfect and imperfect tenses; when one should use one or the other. What was the going rate for an hour of English homework supervision? Tina was hoovering upstairs: what was the exchange rate for a full vacuum cleaner bag? What were these things worth us? Obviously, we were being fed and sheltered, but we had to be sure to spend the wages of our travails - time in Austria - wisely. That night Hans and Sarah told us how everyone who spends any time in Vienna in wintertime should spend some of that time.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Schneeschuhewandern. </em>You know - snow&#x2026;shoe&#x2026;hiking,&#x201D; Sarah said slowly, because, let&#x2019;s face it, it&#x2019;s hard to say in either language. &#x201C;We can arrange it, if you&#x2019;re interested, that is. You can wear our clothes - we have enough. Take some of these too,&#x201D; Silvia said, handing us four sets of Nordic walking poles. She was a big fan of Nordic walking, the slightly comic - to my eyes, anyway - practise of walking around on city streets using ski-type sticks as if one was up a mountain instead of outside an Aldi. We arranged our work shedule to be free on Saturday, she booked us in, and come the weekend we left the house at daybreak, a riot of orange, yellow, and red high-visibility jackets and hats. I felt self-conscious on the three U-Bahn legs we took just to reach the pick-up spot on the edge of the city for the drive south, but the reality is that in Austria no-one bats an eyelid at gaudily-attired families on their way to the slopes. In a minivan we were driven south-west, halfway to Graz, through the Semmering pass, famous for its quaint old railway. Up to that point the roads had looked as they&#x2019;d looked to us on our drive to the Wachau. But from around about that point things started to get quite snowy and spectacular. At the town of M&#xFC;rzzuschlag, having just crossed into the region of Styria, we turned out of the valley and followed a minor road up into the mountains.</p>","<p>As soon as we got out of the minivan, a good ninety minutes from Vienna at that stage, Alexander and Eoin nosed around in the small drifts of snow that were piled up against heaps of cut-down branches and discarded wood in the parking area, gathering enough material to throw at each other. A momentous introduction in this journey of ours had just been made: boys, snow; snow, boys. First contact had been made. They might never have been in snow before but they certainly knew what it was for: throwing at people. And they quickly experienced the unpleasantness of a snowball down the back of the neck.</p>","<p>In an adjacent field on an elevated plateau, the whole party of twenty or so of us (from a few minivans) got to practice walking around with snow shoes on. Not easy. Imagine a plastic skateboard with no wheels that the front of your boot straps in to, and therefore moves with, but as you lift your leg to move uphill, the rear half falls down, waiting for you to land on it each step of the way. We set off at a duck-walk, feet splayed outwards, up through the woods, and quickly found out, both Tina and I, that to the many pleasures of <em>Schneeschuhewandern</em> must be added the frequent stopping and readjusting of kids&#x2019; shoe-to-boot bindings, front and back, which work themselves loose constantly under the strain of pulling and dragging through so much snow, and of not being done right in the first place. Squatting down wasn&#x2019;t easy in snow shoes - and then with gloves off, manoeuvring Alexander or Eoin&#x2019;s boot into the snug position wasn&#x2019;t easy either. Then they&#x2019;d kind of fall over on their arse. Then I would.</p>","<p>We were accompanied by one of the guys from Abenteuerakademie.at, the group that had organised today&#x2019;s <em>Abenteuer</em>. He had a Taiwanese girlfriend. &#x201C;That must be tough&#x201D;, I said.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ja, we have to speak in English.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Does she like the snow too?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, actually, she lives in Taiwan.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;That must be tough. Bu hao.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ja, bu hao.&#x201D;</p>","<p>The summit came after about two hours, and at 1,370 metres high, nearly four-and-a-half thousand feet, it wasn&#x2019;t the highest mountain in the vicinity by a long shot, but it was more than enough for today. We emerged out of the woods just below the top onto a ridge looking down into the valley through which we&#x2019;d driven to get here, the road meandering through it like a river. On the other side of the valley, the mountains of Lower Austria led the eye back up towards the great city of Wien itself. The end of the line for us today was the mountain H&#xFC;tte right at the top. <em>Fritattensuppe </em>(strips of pancake in soup) and chicken schnitzel never tasted so good as they did that lunchtime. Nor beer. Nor, for dessert, Apfelstrudel.</p>","<p>Outside the hut* *there were sleds lying around, and, outside again, Alexander and Eoin ran around the hut until they got tired of that and climbed up on some logs piled up in a pretty pile. I myself was beginning to freeze again what with all the not moving around much for the past hour or so, but they were having a laugh, so I was happy. Just then an angry man came out of the hut and shouted at the two of them to get off the logpile. We knew that that was what he meant because of his rapid, explosive arm movement, the elevation of his eyebrows, and his overall decibel level. Given that the boys had been climbing over a pile of thick, heavy-duty logs, tenuously locked in position by nothing more than gravity and their surface irregularities, which stability might, I had to admit, now that I was yanked out of the pleasant reverie of watching them play, at any moment be upset, with limb-crushing, odyssey-ending consequences, that he had read the situation better than I had. &#x201C;Yeah, c&#x2019;mon kids - down. Now!&#x201D; Turning back to go inside, the man shot me a despairing look.</p>","<p>Alexander and Eoin felt hard done by. In Australia, there would have been a sign warning children that the pile of massive logs could be dangerous and that they shouldn&#x2019;t climb over it. The lack of any such sign here meant, by default, that it was game on. In fact, if it hadn&#x2019;t been for the man&#x2019;s outspoken intervention, I&#x2019;d have taken my camera out to capture the moment. What strange land did we find ourselves in, where heavy woody danger lurked in the most Christmassy, postcardy of scenes, unseen to all but the most experienced of natives? We were lucky that this man, a total stranger, and ill-prepared sartorially for external conditions to boot, had thought to come out of the warmth of the hut to warn us of the dangers, that, not being northerners, we could barely be expected to be aware of. The combined effects of heavy wood, movement, children, and gravity, in these unfamiliar sub-zero conditions, could easily combine, I saw now, to make a pile of logs turn childkiller at the footfall of a passing fox, or a gormless parent clomping around with a camera.</p>","<p>Some daredevils went all the way down to the bottom again on a sled, but we were chastened now, and chicken with it. I was thinking of the long road ahead of us and how easier it would be without one of our eight legs being broken, so we walked down like old farts, enjoying the length of the day and the lack of a hurry. Gathered at the bottom, I considered we&#x2019;d been lucky with the weather, how despite the cold, which was biting now, it hadn&#x2019;t really been cold. Still, my experience hillwalking in Connemara, in the west of Ireland, had taught me that this part, the waiting around at the end for the last of the stragglers to reach base, is when the cold bites the most. It&#x2019;s late, you&#x2019;ve stopped moving. You notice how cold the day really is. I wanted to feel it, though! At least, writing this now, I think I did. I want to know what cold is, I thought, and I want M&#xFC;rzzuschlag to show me.</p>","<p>Life was good. The trip was taking shape. I&#x2019;d thrown sticks into the great river earlier in the week and now we&#x2019;d left footprints in the Alps, or at least in the safe snow of the pre-Alps, as mountains like these are called. It was the first time snow hiking for all of us, and Tina and I had successfully delivered Alexander and Eoin, virgins both, into a field full of snow. Now they were men of the world.</p>"],["<p>Our expeditions grew more ambitious as we got the measure of the house, its work and its people, and were able to schedule more time off. One fine, freezing morning, after doing our chores, we caught the train to Bratislava. How great it was to be able to just commute from one European capital to another so easily, I thought, huddled with my family and three other suffering people in a tiny shelter somewhere east of the city on the most wind-chilled train platform it&#x2019;s ever been my misfortune to be on, waiting for the 8:35 to Slovakia. I&#x2019;d read last night that Bratislava is the only capital, anywhere, that straddles two countries&#x2019; borders. Vienna lies right on the easternmost part of Austria, and so given that Bratislava is just over the border, we&#x2019;d barely be scratching the surface of Slovakia in our day trip. Still, a new country is worth a morning train ride, even if just to see different-coloured buses and the odd funny ol&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x17E;&#x2019; or &#x2018;&#x161;&#x2019; on the street signs.</p>","<p>Bratislava looked like Vienna&#x2019;s shy little brother, and as we walked through quaint old squares occasional manifestations of wacky Slovak humour helped us endure the stinging cold. A statue of a heroic figure in the main square, which is called Main Square by the way, was finished in gold, but had, instead of a head&#x2026;a ghetto-blaster. The crazy bastards! Nearby, a weathered bronze Napoleon caricature propped himself behind a bench. Rounding a corner we nearly fell into a manhole out of which half-emerged a bronze miner with a cheery grin resting his chin on his hands. The goofy so-and-sos.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Construction of the town fortifications began in the 13th century; by the end of the 14th century the town had three gates, of which this building was the best-preserved,&#x201D; said the brochure to the arms museum of Michael&#x2019;s Gate in the old city. We poked display cabinets of all manner of bladed weapons, tournament arms, and motley gunsmithery such as luxury hunting rifles, saddle guns, and riding carbines. The brochure lamented that &#x201C;Gunmaking as a craft reached its climax in the 18th century,&#x201D; and one sensed that as far as the writer was concerned it was all downhill from there.</p>","<p>On the top floor of the museum an old guy sat, wordlessly, possibly asleep, or worse. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s through this door?&#x201D; I asked him in Slovakian, or English - I can&#x2019;t remember which. He got up wordlessly, which seemed to be his thing - wordlessness - and pulled back the rope that had barred access to the door and opened it. Why, Bratislava, of course, was through the door! On the outside balcony, we looked out over the small sea of terracotta roof tiles of old Pressburg, Bratislava&#x2019;s one-time name. In the near distance was the acropolis - the city on the hill. It had terracotta-coloured &#x2018;Carcassone cones&#x2019;, as I like to call them, or &#x2018;cones&#x2019;, as they&#x2019;re better known as, on each of the corner towers.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Hey, look at that castle.&#x201D; I pointed it out to Tina. &#x201C;We should go there.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;We will be, after lunch. It&#x2019;s called Bratislava Castle.&#x201D;</p>","<p>The castle is actually on an isolated rocky hill of the Little Carpathians mountain range, and from there the Danube flees southeast. A short distance downstream it forms the border with Hungary. In fact, you can see all the way to Hungary from up there on a clear day. Alas, today was no such day. We&#x2019;d be in Hungary soon enough, though, all going well.</p>","<p>In the main shopping street of Obchodn&#xE1; we found the place people like us are meant to find. The Slovak Pub &#x201C;is not only a pub, it is an institution.&#x201D; We entered its main dining room with a tremendous sense of destiny fulfilled. On the walls hung gilt-framed portraits of Slovak dignitaries. The menu was as much a history textbook as much as it was an inventory of the food they served here. We were in &#x2018;&#x160;t&#xFA;r&#x2019;s Room&#x2019;, turned out.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Hey kids. You see those guys in the pictures? You&#x2019;ll never guess who they were.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t care.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know, Dad.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Nineteenth-century Slovak intellectuals,&#x201D; I said, reading from the menu. &#x201C;Luminaries who collaborated with &#x13D;udov&#xED;t &#x160;t&#xFA;r - that&#x2019;s the guy in the main picture on the mountain with the rifle and the white pantaloons. By the way boys, don&#x2019;t wear white trousers if you&#x2019;re in a war. Anyway, those guys played a crucial role in codifying the Slovak orthography and making it the official language. Bet you didn&#x2019;t know that. They were the very driving force behind the Slovak national revival.&#x201D; What an excellent menu.</p>","<p>Thawing nicely now, Tina and I ordered a litre and a half of Zlat&#xFD; ba&#x17E;ant 10&#xB0; and set to deciphering the menu. <em>Bryndzov&#xE9; halu&#x161;ky so slaninou</em>, potato dumplings with <em>bryndza</em> (Slovak sheep cheese) and bacon were quickly conveyed to our wooden, red gingham-covered table. Flicking through the menu I read about how <em>halu&#x161;ky </em>is made. First, the farmer sows potatoes and wheat &#x201C;in a sweat&#x201D;. Then he takes a break and blows on his <em>fujara</em> a bit, an upright monotubular wind instrument by the looks of things. Then, somehow - I didn&#x2019;t really understand the next few stages; sheep are somehow involved - he magically ends up with &#x201C;good shaggy <em>halu&#x161;ky&#x201D;. &#x201C;And this is how our traditional meal is made in our beautiful country.&#x201D;</em> In case you don&#x2019;t believe that it was all that simple, the menu asserts that &#x201C;<em>the hill Polana is the witness</em>&#x201D; to the whole shaggy process. Hills don&#x2019;t lie. The weirdest part of the meal, both orthographically and morphologically, was the <em>cesnakov&#xE1; polievka kr&#xE9;mov&#xE1; v bochn&#xED;ku posypan&#xE1; syrom</em>, which is creamy garlic soup in a loaf of home-made bread. That&#x2019;s right: the soup is in the bread. You eat the tureen. A popular meal before dishwashers were invented, I imagine.</p>","<p>We overate. We overate because despite being slightly odd - the food - this food came from the &#x201C;grandmother&#x2019;s dishes&#x201D; section of the menu, and grandmothers always give you too much food.</p>","<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re about the same distance from Hans and Sarah&#x2019;s that were when we were up on Richard the Lionheart&#x2019;s prison castle in Die Wachau, and still on the Danube,&#x201D; I said to no-one in particular. I like to make sense of my world, establishing comparative distances, especially in strange new places like Bratislava.</p>","<p>Barring Greece, this was already the furthest east I&#x2019;d ever been on mainland Europe. When I did my InterRailing trip all those years ago, Hungary, East Germany, Poland - these were all verboten, all full of dark-faced security gooks and party apparatchiks and other words we didn;t really understand. Alexander and Eoin would never know that world, but to be honest it never greatly affected me one way or the other. Faced with a map of Europe with fully half of it roped off I&#x2019;d just spent more time exploring Munich, Denmark, Venice, and Paris, and not concerned myself with unglamorous Eastern European states like Slovakia, then half of Czechoslovakia, of course.</p>","<hr>","<p>After about two weeks confined to the <em>L&#xE4;nder</em> of Vienna and Lower Austria (with a brief incursion into upper Styria), and of course our trip over the border into Bratislava, it was time to run a little experiment. We&#x2019;d proven to ourselves that Help Exchange worked for us, that we could stay with a family and sing for our <em>Abendessen</em>. We could play board games in the evening after mornings spent walking the boulevards or through palaces gazing at Maria Theresa&#x2019;s boudoir, as long as Sarah&#x2019;s floors were swept, her dishwasher stacked, and the difference between the perfect and the imperfect past tenses were drilled into her offspring&#x2019;s heads. It was time to test a second hypothesis and see if we could branch out for a short-term mini break using a different website/social network. Salzburg was our choice for a weekend break, and we got in touch with a family there who seemed willing to host us for our first Couchsurfing stay. Couchsurfing, if you don&#x2019;t already know, is a website which brings people looking for short term (two days or so) stays together with people willing to host them. For free, I might add. With no work obligations, I might also add. Why would anyone do this?, you might ask. I wasn&#x2019;t quite sure myself, to be honest, but that was the point of the experiment. To find out what the catch was. Once again, we got ahead of ourselves with our work and arranged to have the weekend off. Nina, in Salzburg, accepted our request for a two-night stay. With the weather noticeably warming those in the mornings, we left for Salzburg on the Saturday morning of our last weekend in Donaustadt. Out of the flat lands of Lower Austria, not far south of our magical Wachau, we clocked some good speeds on the train, pushing 250 km/h at one stage.</p>","<p>&#x201C;What do we know about&#x2026;Nina, is it?&#x201D; I asked Tina, who as usual had organised the whole thing.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, they sound like an adventurous lot. We had to rearrange our times between their recent ski trip and their upcoming house exchange in London.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;What, they&#x2019;re going to swap houses with people in London?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Loads of people do that. Homeexchange.com.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I suppose for them putting us up for a weekend is small beer in comparison. I feel better. Should we bring her something. A bottle of wine, the usual?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;She says on her profile she wants a stone from our home country for her garden project - just a normal stone from a river or the sea shore, nothing special.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Boys - you don&#x2019;t, either of you, by any chance have any Australian stones on you? I can pay you back.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh well, we can just get her a bottle of wine in Salzburg.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh yeah, that&#x2019;s another thing. They don&#x2019;t actually live in Salzburg.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh? That&#x2019;s disappointing. That&#x2019;s where this train&#x2019;s going.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, they don&#x2019;t live far away, about a half hour by train. In a village called Oberndorf bei Salzburg. When we&#x2019;re finished sightseeing today we&#x2019;ll just catch the train up to theirs.&#x201D;</p>","<p>One is drawn to cross the river Salzach over the pedestrianised Makartsteg. As we did so, pedlars ground out bad music into the cold air and the blue sky, some of them having lunch of bread on tablecloths spread out over suitcases right there on the <em>steg</em>. The &#x2018;<em>steg</em>&#x2019; suffix tells you it&#x2019;s a pedestrian bridge, or at least a small one, unlike the usual word for bridge, <em>Br&#xFC;cke</em>, as in Innsbruck - the bridge over the river Inn.</p>","<p>From early on in one&#x2019;s traversal of the Makartsteg, one notices a number of the by-now familiar love padlocks, <em>Liebesschl&#xF6;sser</em>, that romantic people put on famous bridges like this one. By the middle of the river I estimated there were over a hundred locks per square metre. Funnily enough, not only do all the very romantic people do exactly the same thing, but the locks they buy are all the same colour: the red of embarrassment. I imagined if I was young and brought a girl here I&#x2019;d stop in the middle of the bridge, gazed fondly upon by the nine-hundred year old Festung Hohensalzburg clifftop fortress, and tell my girl how much I really loved her, or something along those lines, then seal the moment by reminding her that by <em>not</em> buying one of those ghastly lock tokens (or <em>faux</em>kens), we had collectively trousered (in effect) a cool &#x20AC;24,50 (rrp in Salzburg town centre for the red ones), and our love would be only famous because women love a thrifty guy.</p>","<p>On the south side of the Altstadt, with discordant organ music still in our ears, we took the short walk to the <em>Mozarts Geburtshaus</em>. Mozart is everywhere in this town; there&#x2019;s even a Mozarteum (our favourite pieces of Mozartabilia were the fluffy bouncing Mozarts sold in the trinket shop windows and, writing this now, I regret not stealing one). In a walled-in square leading to the Getreidegasse, which seemed to be the main shopping drag, I was happy to acknowledge the house where Mozart was born and leave it at that.</p>","<p>We found a windy, narrow old street called Steingasse running along the foot of the hill on the north side. To a first approximation, Salzburg is evenly bisected by the Salzach, and right at its centre has a mountain on either side, mountains of roughly equal proportions, both very close to the river, both wooded. Steingasse, apparently, was the way one set out for Vienna in the days before trains or planes could take you there. In the narrow passageway we passed an eminently photographable wooden <em>T&#xE4;ndlerei</em> shop front: I am informed that a <em>T&#xE4;ndler</em> is a person who sells bits and pieces of everything. It wasn&#x2019;t hard to imagine travelers making a last-minute stop here for some clothing, a knife, or a lamp, before hitting the road east to the capital.</p>","<p>If you look at any pictures of Salzburg, you&#x2019;ll see it&#x2019;s dominated by a white-walled castle running the entire brow of one of the main hills overlooking the town. In an early instance occurrence of one of the recurring motifs of our big trip, we ended up walking up the hill, then up the steps to the front gate, only to decide, at the very the ticket office, against actually going into the Festung Hohensalzburg. Time and again on this trip we went all the way up to some famous national monument we&#x2019;d read about and then&#x2026;left it at that. I considered denying all this, and pretending to our friends, and to you, dear reader, that we had had a splendid time wandering the Festung&#x2019;s courtyards and hallways. But we couldn&#x2019;t afford four tickets (maybe &#x20AC;35) into every place we went to with such a long road ahead of us.</p>","<p>In Caf&#xE9; Tomaselli later on, one of Mozart&#x2019;s favourite haunts, we endured the patronising hauteur of the waiters who, smelling our impecunity, realised there would be no tip forthcoming. We made our way back to the train station thinking that they were going to have to do something about the crush of tourists in such a small space if they wanted people to keep coming to Salzburg. And maybe teach the waiters at the Tomaselli some manners while they were at it.</p>","<hr>","<p>The town of Oberndorf bei Salzburg, some twenty or so kilometres downstream on the Salzach from Salzburg, is where the first performance of Silent Night happened, in the Stille Nacht Kapelle, and where the first of our couchsurfing stays happened. Our &#x2018;couch&#x2019; was the cosy top floor of a semi-detached house, with plenty of space, Lego stuff everywhere for Alexander and Eoin to play with. We&#x2019;d clearly struck gold on our first try with Couchsurfing. We just kept waiting for a &#x2018;catch&#x2019; that never came. We even our own bathroom, although it was clear from a sign on the wall that Nina expected me, Alexander, and Eoin to be <em>Sitzpinklers</em> for the duration. That is to say, one was expected to sit down while pinkling. Little did we realise it at the time, but this was quite the big issue in Germany. A judge in Dusseldorf had recently ruled in favour of a man&#x2019;s right to urinate while standing up, declaring that &#x201C;Despite growing domestication of men in this matter, urinating while standing up is still common practice.&#x201D; But it was Nina&#x2019;s house, and her rules. I wonder if it applied to her husband Felix too. I called a plenary council for the men in our group, and adjudicated in accordance with the house rules in the matter of urinating while erect, so to speak. We were just relieved not to be in the basement. We even had a window. From our window, in fact, we could see over the neighbours&#x2019; gardens into Germany.</p>","<p>Over dinner, Nina told us about the blog she&#x2019;d been writing for a couple of years, which dealt mainly with parenting and autism. She was finally beginning to get picked up by magazines, and even paid occasionally. We asked Nina for blogging tips. I&#x2019;d put up a couple of posts from Donaustadt at that stage, but in the couple of years we&#x2019;d been writing it, it never seemed to get any momentum at all. After every post we&#x2019;d notice a few hits, but it would go cold again in short order.</p>","<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the thing,&#x201D; Nina explained. &#x201C;You have to keep going with it. All the time! Most bloggers just give up.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;How often do you post to your blog?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I post two articles every week.&#x201D;</p>","<p>That&#x2019;s a <em>lot</em>. &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m planning on writing a book when we get to Greece.&#x201D; Yes, that was my big plan. I&#x2019;d spend the time we&#x2019;d have in Greece, April until July or so, sitting down at a table and banging out a book. &#x201C;I just don&#x2019;t know what to do with our blog. I&#x2019;ve written some stuff about Vienna in it, and I&#x2019;ll probably write about this weekend. But I&#x2019;m not sure why, or what it&#x2019;s even for.&#x201D;</p>","<p>We probably wrote a blog for the same reasons most people did: to let our friends and family know what we were up to and to serve as a kind of journal, or diary, for ourselves to enjoy in the future. But those two reasons couldn&#x2019;t be the only ones, because we could have just emailed our friends our news, and kept a Word document as a diary. It could be hard work keeping up a blog, and working out how the software worked. There must have been something else.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ya, you have to know what you&#x2019;re doing it for,&#x201D; Felix said. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s been doing it for a few years, and it&#x2019;s only now that she finally receives some attention.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;And some money. A parenting magazine has offered me some money to use one of my posts.&#x201D;</p>","<p>While we chatted I looked at Alexander and Eoin playing softball in the front room with two Salzburg boys around the same age as them. Felix poured more wine, and Nina got up and cut more cheese. They were excited about their trip to London next month.</p>","<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re not worried about complete strangers being in your house?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;No!&#x201D; She was surprised at the question. &#x201C;We trust them. We will be in their place, after all, and they have good reviews.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;And anyway,&#x201D; Tina reminded me, &#x201C;we have complete strangers in our house in Brisbane. For eighteen months.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t remind me.&#x201D; Travelling is about letting go as much as anything else. We&#x2019;d had to walk out the front door of our house one morning shortly before leaving, past a crowd of people gathered outside, while they filed in past us to inspect the place prior to deciding whether it was good enough for them to rent. We&#x2019;d had to let go of our beloved Abyssinian cat, Koukla, leaving her with a neighbour the week we left, only to hear, this week, that she&#x2019;d been found dead on a road near our house. We hadn&#x2019;t been able to bring ourselves to tell the boys yet.</p>","<p>Next morning Nina took us over the &#x2018;Europasteg&#x2019; bridge, spanning the Salzach, to the village of Laufen (which means &#x2018;to walk&#x2019;) in Germany. As well as hosting a handful of lacklustre <em>Liebesschl&#xF6;sser</em>, the halfway point of the Europasteg marked the Austro-Germanic border, with &#x2018;Land Salzburg&#x2019; on one side of a line and &#x2018;Freistaat Bayern&#x2019; on the other. After a quick stop for a melange it was time to leave Germany.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Hope you enjoyed it, boys,&#x201D; I said, as we recrossed the Salzach over the more impressive Salzachbr&#xFC;cke. &#x201C;We won&#x2019;t be back until the end of the summer.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;You are going to Germany on your trip?&#x201D; asked Nina.</p>","<p>&#x201C;If we can find a couch in Berlin we hope to go there after Greece, in July or August.&#x201D; Considering she was the reason our weekend&#x2019;s experiment had turned out a success, and given that we&#x2019;d overlooked garden stones when we&#x2019;d packed for our trip in Brisbane, when we thanked her and left her house we offered Nina the only gift we could: to stay with us in Koukla House, the house we&#x2019;d be staying in in Zakynthos for the spring once we&#x2019;d finished our chores in Austria and had seen Budapest. That was the plan at that point.</p>"],["<p>The vernal equinox had come and gone as we&#x2019;d slept in our basement like bears in a cave, and astronomical spring had arrived. The Earth was heating up, softening; we could feel it in the air and beneath our feet. Mornings were no longer the trial by icy wind they&#x2019;d been three weeks ago. The daffodils were out. The white and purple carnations at Franz Schubert&#x2019;s grave came to life. We were Hungary-bound in a few days, following the Danube round the bend, heading south. In the Lainzer Tiergarten we picked fistfuls of wild garlic with which to garnish our sandwiches as boars grazed nearby. The city ends abruptly here at this park, the Hapsburgs&#x2019; one-time private hunting grounds. We were even able to take our jackets off sitting outside on the benches of Das Rohrhaus, the <em>Gasthof</em> at the top of Lainzer.</p>","<p>Over a <em>halb</em> liter of G&#xF6;sser beer and a <em>viertel</em> of Gr&#xFC;ner Veltliner white wine (guess who drank which) we looked down at the palace at Sch&#xF6;nbrunn and remembered the mornings weeks earlier we&#x2019;d spent there. Right beside the Palace there was the zoo where Alexander and Eoin saw their first Pandas, falling head over tail from a hollowed-out log over and over again. The pleasure kids get from pandas. The pleasure parents get from seeing their kids getting pleasure from pandas. Later that same afternoon, despite being too small to see over the hedges, the boys had managed, by running in every direction tirelessly, to find their way out of the maze in the gardens just beside Neptune&#x2019;s fountain before we had. They watched us from the elevated observation platform, all of it below the Gloriette, that wildly over the top gazebo. In fact, that&#x2019;s what &#x2018;Gloriette&#x2019; means (not &#x2018;wildly over the top gazebo&#x2019;, just &#x2018;gazebo&#x2019;).</p>","<p>No, it wouldn&#x2019;t be long till Easter, and the painted eggstravaganza at Der Ostereierstand (auf der Freyung) in the Altwiener Ostermarkt was in full swing. Eggboxes with gold and silver painted eggs, draped in muslin, were everywhere. The market is right outside the Schottenkirche, the Catholic church, founded, incidentally, by Irish and Scottish Benedictine monks nine hundred years ago. Even the closed-in Judenplatz, with its &#x2018;Nameless Library&#x2019; Holocaust memorial, looked, dare I say, cheery with a splash of spring sunshine. Nearby, under the rib-vaulted ceiling and chandeliers of the storied Caf&#xE9; Central, we found our grandest caf&#xE9; yet. Intellectuals came here.</p>","<p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;ll you have?&#x201D; Tina asked me.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Whatever the logical positivists had, that&#x2019;ll be good enough for me.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Viennese caf&#xE9;s had given me one of my favourite German words: <em>Einsp&#xE4;nner, </em>which gave me satisfaction each time I used it, (another favourite German word was <em>Handynummer</em>: mobile phone number<em>), </em>and also one of the worst: <em>Schlagobels</em>, which means cream, but just made me think of the Nazi Minister of Propaganda on a slagheap.</p>","<p>I&#x2019;d finally finished the weeding, and Hans had borrowed a spiked roller from his neighbour so we could aerate the garden. As I supped my einsp&#xE4;nner, I reflected on how pleased it made me to think I&#x2019;d helped Hans get his garden ready for the spring. It wasn&#x2019;t much of a garden, but I&#x2019;d helped him with it. And we&#x2019;d gotten away with only having to clean their toilets once. One of my more interesting tasks had been to help young Philippe compile some photographs and text about a family trip to Kenya they&#x2019;d done the previous year into a series of Powerpoint Slides. I learned some interesting things doing that job, the main one being that if you&#x2019;re going to help someone with their computer, and you&#x2019;re in Austria, and you speak English, go to Windows Control Panel -&gt; System and Security, and switch to English. As much as I&#x2019;m an opportunistic language learner, taking lessons where I can find them, struggling to make sense of Windows commands in German is not the way to learn a language.</p>","<p>We&#x2019;d survived their fearsome recycling schedule. This nation of knob-twiddling technocrats would have you walk through a terraced maze of houses in the drizzle to a lock-up cage, freezing fingers fumbling with keys in the rain, just to drop off an empty peach tin, before making your way to the bottle recycling unit out on the street, the rain heavier now, to correctly deposit an empty Staud&#x2019;s Famous Pickles jar, then finally back in through the iron gate, into the tiny garden, thoroughly soaked and pissed off, to stash a folded tetrapak of organic soy milk (not before it had been washed properly, of course). How I missed the simplicity of Greece, where it all just gets fucked into the one bin, from a fast moving car by the look of things, which might explain the Greeks&#x2019; fondness for basketball, a game they just call &#x2018;basket&#x2019;.</p>","<p>&#x201C;You know,&#x201D; I said, waxing all satisfied, &#x201C;All this - a month in Vienna - has been given to us gratis, virtually. I mean, we haven&#x2019;t had to pay a cent in accommodation, and we&#x2019;ve done everything we wanted to do. We&#x2019;ve had weekends off, to go to Salzburg if we wanted, traipse around the mountains, or just go in to town nice and early and explore the crypts of Steffl like we did that morning. Then have coffee at Caf&#xE9; Braunerhof or Hawelka, or here. And now we&#x2019;re off to Budapest. Not a bad start to the trip, I&#x2019;d say.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;We still have to sweep and mop the basement. In fact, we&#x2019;re due another full sweep and mop of the house before we go: we&#x2019;ve only done one this week.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ah Jaysus.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;And you have to clean the shower. Or do you want to do the toilet and I&#x2019;ll do the shower?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Shower.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ok, but do it properly. I know you. I&#x2019;ll leave the cleaning stuff out. And put your mattress back where you got it. Finish up your coffee - you&#x2019;ve got English with Mara after lunch. We don&#x2019;t want to get back too late.&#x201D;</p>","<hr>","<p>Daylight was fading over the rows of terraces out Mara&#x2019;s bedroom window. Finally, we had a plausible scenario for her story, if you allow for talking animals whose motives were as vindictive as they were arbitrary, that involved all twenty-five of the words she had to use. &#x201C;My name is Jeremy and I&#x2019;m a crow,&#x201D; it started. She was Boswell to my Johnson, and while she scribbled away, I flicked through her shelf of books, curious to see what teenage girls were reading in Austria these days. A good half of the books, amazingly, were in English. Harry Potter, Enid Blyton, Horrible Histories. There was a piano keyboard in the room on a foldable stand. She got everything I said, and corrected me, or at least made me justify every use of the perfect and the imperfect, and why I&#x2019;d used one and not the other, that I came out with. Not a word was wasted on her. There wasn&#x2019;t going to be much this kid wouldn&#x2019;t be able to do when she grew up. Maybe one day she could even explain those tenses to her Dad.</p>","<p>She moved constantly on her big blue exercise ball as we wrote our little story, flexing her limbs, arching her back, young and elastic. All that energy. As usual, I was tired from the day&#x2019;s wanderings. I tried to think back to when Tina and I first heard about the idea of work exchange from a travel blogging family we met, and how it seemed to me like it was only something backpackers or twenty-year olds would do. But here I was, a good bit over twenty, and I&#x2019;d just written a story about a crow called Jeremy with a teenage girl, and that (together with a small bit of weeding and dishwasher loading) had earned me and my family a place in her family&#x2019;s house for the past three and a half weeks.</p>"]]},{"index":2,"title":"The Worst Apartment in Budapest","pages":[["<p>A tall, young, bearded guy who looked strode through the hall of Vienna&#x2019;s Bahnhof Meidling train station, went out the massive glass doors, walked across the forecourt and without breaking stride got straight onto a bus which had pulled in just in time for him to walk on and which pulled away as soon as he was on board, for all the world an actor in a well choreographed performance. He was shoeless, the arse was out of his pants, he had wild hair, but the purpose with which he crossed the threshold from one situation to another surprised me. We were in the hall, killing time. It was miserable cold outside. The homeless guy had walked, though, as if through a more southern clime. As if he had a meeting to go to. He had nothing, but in that moment he at least seemed to have purpose. &#x201C;Come on, time to go,&#x201D; Tina said. I put my takeaway cup in a bin and walked off with my family, each of us with a suitcase and a backpack, to catch the mid-morning train to Budapest.</p>","<p>Our early departure that morning from Donaustadt meant that both Hans and Sarah were still having their breakfast when we left. Today it was our turn to go to work first - we had new people to see and a new city to explore. It would be tough; we didn&#x2019;t have a word of Hungarian between us. And once again we were entrusting our trip into the arms of strangers, a modus operandi that even after nearly a month in Vienna still felt all wrong.</p>","<p>To save money we&#x2019;d only bought tickets to Ferencv&#xE1;ros, the stop before Keleti, Budapest&#x2019;s main train station. When images of large numbers of Syrians massing in Keleti started appearing on TV during the migration crisis six months later we didn&#x2019;t recognise it. We got out at the stop before. Anyway, like a lot of things in life, on paper that choice had made perfect sense but what we found that morning was that that particular station turned out to be nothing more than a platform with a bridge to an adjacent light-industrial area, a kilometre from Aut&#xF3;busz&#xE1;llom&#xE1;s N&#xE9;pliget bus station, the nearest outpost of civilization. A kilometre&#x2019;s not much to walk, but it&#x2019;s like five when everyone, including Alexander and Eoin, has a suitcase and a backpack. Poor Alexander was in tears at his outrageous misfortune at actually having to shlep his own possessions around. For my part, well, the dubious wisdom of going for the dirt-cheap option in a Malaysian luggage shop the previous year was beginning to show; my suitcase was starting to come apart at the seams. Like a stricken airliner, we just had to land. At N&#xE9;pliget we divested ourselves of our luggage, warmed ourselves with a couple of buns, and exchanged our euros for some coin of the realm.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Here you go boys; forints.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Hungary&#x2019;s in the EU - it&#x2019;s even in Schengen - but it&#x2019;s not in the eurozone, so forints it&#x2019;d be for the next seven days. The first time I went abroad as a young teenager, to Paris, I fell in love with the silver one-franc coins. They seemed stylish, and even revolutionary, with those resonant words <em>R&#xE9;publique Fran&#xE7;aise</em> on them, but even more important, they had a graceful woman sowing seeds. While the rest of the world&#x2019;s peasantry broke their backs French women leant back in the manner of an athlete about to throw a discus, or a ballerina flexing. Incidentally, Irish coins were quite stylish too; they were just more minimal, with salmon, bulls, and even the odd rabbit, if you went back to the pre-decimal days, which I could just about remember. This was the first time on this trip, after one month, where we&#x2019;d seen new coinage. We were all familiar with euros from trips back to Europe over the years. Forints were new though. Forints were sexy. This was a big moment.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Hey Dad, where are we staying tonight?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Anna&#x2019;s - remember?&#x201D;</p>","<p>Two people had answered our request for accommodation in Budapest on couchsurfing - Anna and Stefan. Anna would meet us on her way home from work that night, right there at N&#xE9;pliget, conveniently enough (although I had my suspicions that Tina had arranged it that way). Without our luggage we glided along the corridors of the bus station as light as helium released, down to the train platforms, and caught the Metro into Pest.</p>","<p>Geographically and orthographically, Buda and Pest follow the same left to right order - Pest is the right-hand side of both the word and the conurbation of Budapest, a lexigraphically satisfying state of affairs. Basing ourselves around Liberty Bridge (<em>Szabads&#xE1;g h&#xED;d</em>), we shuttled back and forth like the yellow trams, between the Gell&#xE9;rt Baths in Buda, where we looked in through the railings at the hardy outdoor bathers, and the old Central Market Hall in Pest where we stocked up on some of the cute little red, green, and white bags of paprika, presents for when we got to Greece the following week.</p>","<p>Budapest&#x2019;s most dramatic feature is an acropolis on the Buda side, about twice as long as the Acropolis of Athens, from what I could remember (it had been about six years since we&#x2019;d been to Athens - surely we&#x2019;d get there on this trip at some stage). The Galeria, with its copper-green cupola, seemed the most prominent of the acropolis&#x2019;s buuildings, and would be visited by us presently.</p>","<p>In a fit of spontaneity, extensively researched by Tina beforehand, we took a small bus that went through a tunnel in the rock of Buda, and found a nice old caf&#xE9; called the D&#xE9;ryn&#xE9; Bisztr&#xF3;. Looking up the website of the D&#xE9;ryn&#xE9; on my phone as I waited for my coffee and cake, Google offered to translate it from Hungarian. Machine translation - in fact, good ol&#x2019; artificial intelligence - is everywhere nowadays. I read that &#x201C;Auguszt opened a confectionery, Krisztina t&#xE9;r 3, at the base and attack silently around the street market was built in the early century refreshingly small town, yet disturbingly high society Krisztinav&#xE1;ros. S&#xE1;ndor M&#xE1;rai adored civil g&#x151;gj&#xE9;&#xE9;rt, terrace for romantic, vir&#xE1;gai&#xE9;rt, cool shadow of the church.&#x201D; I looked up. That church, with its cool shadow, was right outside the caf&#xE9;&#x2019;s window, and kind of reminded me of St. Josefskirche, the one on top of Heiligenstadt. We looked around at the &#x201C;disturbingly high society&#x201D; in which we found ourselves, and hoped our couchsurf hosts weren&#x2019;t too aristocratic to put up with us for a few nights.</p>","<hr>","<p>Anna was an economist, a solid, amiable Hungarian, with perfect English. She met us after her work back at N&#xE9;pliget bus station and helped us quickly shove our stuff into the humid security of a busy Metro carriage. A few stops further south we alighted, where she left her car every day. We had no idea where we were. Couchsurfing doesn&#x2019;t give exact addresses, and she&#x2019;d only told us to meet her at the train station. We knew we were south of N&#xE9;pliget, and on one side of the Danube or the other, but it could have been the other way around. What was more, after about three minutes in her car Tina and I realised that we were too far into whatever labyrinth we were in to be able to just stroll out of her place in the morning, which was the general idea, and make our way into the centre from the Metro we&#x2019;d just left. That&#x2019;s usually what you want to be doing if you&#x2019;re couchsurfing. Pointing out landmarks on the way to make it easier for us was kind of her but in the dark I remember thinking that she might as well have been pointing to Orion and commenting on his belt.</p>","<p>As friendly as Anna was, her husband either didn&#x2019;t speak English or just didn&#x2019;t like to; we couldn&#x2019;t really work it out. In our eagerness to express our gratitude, we thanked him profusely and he seemed to be able to understand some of what we were saying, but that was it from him for the night. And the next one. I&#x2019;ll be honest. He unnerved me. As long as Anna was in the house, however, we were safe.</p>","<p>&#x201C;My daughter is studying arts in Edinburgh. This is your room.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Once again, we had an entire floor of a house all to ourselves, if you didn&#x2019;t count the angry, howling troll of a dog just outside the door in the yard. There was a kitchenette, and a bathroom and shower. Really, you&#x2019;d pay good money for this if it wasn&#x2019;t so hard to get to.</p>","<p>English-language books made us feel at home. Oscar Wilde, Emily Bront&#xEB;, James Joyce. They say <em>Ulysses</em> is a book you can&#x2019;t get away from. Well, here we were in Budapest (at least we thought we must still be within the city limits), and sure enough, there was the great modernist work on the bookshelf. I read out bits of it to Tina as we lay on bed relaxing. Patient at first, she soon fixed me with an annoyed look, as if to say &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll read it myself at some stage, thanks,&#x201D; which she then said. I was casting around for a writing style that I&#x2019;d need if I wanted to be a writer, and for some strange reason, at that stage I thought Joyce was as good a writer as any to get inspiration from, &#x2018;in the labyrinthine hinterlands of the text&#x2019; of Ulysses, maybe.</p>","<p>That evening Anna prepared goulash using some of the paprika we&#x2019;d bought at the Central Market earlier on, but I have to admit that goulash and paprika are two words I prefer the sound of more than the taste of. But that&#x2019;s just a small quibble - her whole family (minus daughter in Scotland, of course) sat down to eat with us; the laconic husband, her nineteen-year-old son Gregor, and her sulky eleven-year-old daughter. Lying in the older daughter&#x2019;s bedroom that first night I thought about how the success of our project relied on Anna and all the other Annas we&#x2019;d meet further downstream. People whose kindness we could sit around and warm our hands to after a day&#x2019;s anonymity in the eastern bloc. When I had told my Mum about our travel plans, and how we intended to chance our arm with some couchsurfing she&#x2019;d just asked me, &#x201C;And they do this for free? Why?&#x201D; I wasn&#x2019;t sure Anna&#x2019;s husband knew the answer to that one either.</p>","<hr>","<p>Driving north through Budapest&#x2019;s inner suburbs the next morning, we passed a lot of ten- to fifteen-floor-high blocks of flats, remarkably uniform in appearance, either side of the wide boulevard we were on. A veritable valley of the giants.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Panels&#x201D;, said Anna. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;re called. The word is actually <em>panelh&#xE1;z</em> but people just call them panels. About a third of the population of Budapest lives in panels.&#x201D;</p>","<p>I was glad we hadn&#x2019;t come to Budapest to stay in a panel. We would have been closer to the city, though. Not that it mattered today. Far from having to pull at the frayed thread of our memory of the night before to find our way out of the residential maze we&#x2019;d gotten ourselves into, Anna offered to take us to an outdoor museum somewhere in the countryside. I deserve a lot in my life, I thought. I&#x2019;ve worked hard, and I&#x2019;m entitled to enjoy the fruits of my labours. But I didn&#x2019;t deserve this woman. Thanks to her, we&#x2019;d be able to say we&#x2019;d see a bit more of Hungary than just the pavements of its capital.</p>","<p>Only about thirty-five kilometres north of the city, the Danube halts its easterly progress and heads due south to transit Budapest, north-south, passing the town of Szentendre on its way. That town&#x2019;s name means &#x2018;Saint Andrew&#x2019; in Hungarian. There you&#x2019;ll find the Skanzen Village Museum, an outdoor museum in the Duna-Ipoly National Park where the nation&#x2019;s different regions - Southern Transdunabia, Balatan-Uplands, etc. - are represented with reconstructed smithies, windmills, churches, even whole villages. Fit types ran past us in small groups, consulting maps and looking this way and that, evidently playing some kind of Capture the Flag or Find the Treasure game. The sheep were as shaggy as the Bratislavan <em>halu&#x161;ky</em> we&#x2019;d had a couple of weeks ago and had dangerous-looking half-metre-long double-helix spiralling horns. Past a Protestant graveyard we walked, past a Greek Catholic church. We ate stew on a red gingham-covered table, probably from the Upper Tsiza region, and I treated myself to a 500ml tin of Soproni, because, as I said, I deserve the good things in life.</p>","<p>In the town of Szentendre itself we browsed the art galleries and souvenir shops of its twisty, touristy lanes and alleys after we&#x2019;d finished at Skanzen. Faced with this wealth of artistic merchandise, Alexander and Eoin, already running low on munitions this early in our trip, opted to re-up their arsenals by buying a wooden sword apiece. It was too cold for some of the more sensitive members (not mentioning any names) of the party to be sitting outside, but Anna and I (and no-one else) sat outside the Keresked&#xF6;h&#xE1;z caf&#xE9; on the tiny cobblestoned main square of this fancy little village. There was beginning to be a lot of migration throughout Europe at around this time, with Syrians working their way up through Greece, the Balkans, and into Hungary itself, en route (they hoped) to Germany or Britain. Migration from a different era had been responsible for the creation of this town.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Serbs settled here in the late seventeenth century. They were refugees from the Turks,&#x201D;, Anna explained. &#x201C;They turned it into a version of what they&#x2019;d had at home, with Serbian churches and shops. Nowadays it&#x2019;s become quite arty and touristy.&#x201D;</p>","<p>I thanked her for bringing us here. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t have the money to be catching buses around, not when each trip means four tickets. We only expected to see Budapest; this is a bonus.&#x201D;</p>","<p>That evening, after we&#x2019;d all eaten, Kristof came out of his bedroom with a huge box of Lego for the lads and placed it in the middle of the room. They all played. With their new wooden swords, they attacked him, but he merely turned and walked into his bedroom and came out with a plastic machine gun and killed them all. Anna handed me another beer. Her husband said very little. He probably hated us; it was hard to tell. We didn&#x2019;t know how to read Hungarians. Anna&#x2019;s daughter pouted and sulked about something or other, but eventually joined in the games with the lads. Anna took photos. It was cosy. We liked it there. I still had no idea where we were in Budapest. Somewhere south.</p>"],["<p>By the end of the summer Hungary was starting to get a bad reputation internationally as a result of its response to the large number of migrants streaming into the country through its Balkan-facing underbelly. Hungary belonged to the Schengen Agreement but the countries south of it didn&#x2019;t, and they were causing it problems. Normal border controls were in place along its border with Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Romania but by the end of the summer the scale of the influx, in particular from non-EU and non-Schengen Serbia was becoming unmanageable. Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n announced that a fence between the two countries was the only way to keep the refugees out. All this would happen a few months after our stay in Budapest, and as we watched the news in Ireland five months later, showing the thousands of people trekking along the sides of the motorways linking Serbia to Budapest, and onwards to Vienna and Munich, we listened with mixed feelings to the denouncements against Hungary since the few people we met in the country during our time there showed us nothing but hospitality.</p>","<hr>","<p>Anna dropped us off at our next place and told us, rather ominously, to call her if we had any problems. I hadn&#x2019;t expected to be so mothered quite so early in our trip, not until I reached Ireland anyway, but I must say, it was nice. Here we were, getting dropped into town and fretted over. It didn&#x2019;t seem a bad area we were in - far from it, in fact: we&#x2019;d been walking near there on our first day, so we had our bearings, sort of, and there was a kids&#x2019; toy shop right on our corner. I suppose it just wasn&#x2019;t somewhere she thought people with kids would normally arrange a couchsurf, and in that she was probably right. When she drove off, she left us with the reassuring feeling that we had a friendly contact in the city, a mighty good feeling to have. But it was also important for us to keep moving forward. We had to leave the nest to grow. And anyway our next host, Stefan, sounded interesting.</p>","<p>He was a legal secretary living just off Ferenc K&#xF6;r&#xFA;t, a wide boulevard near the city centre. He&#x2019;d initially knocked us back, claiming not to have enough room, but said to let him know if we couldn&#x2019;t find anything else. We couldn&#x2019;t, so he agreed to let us stay the next few nights.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Right. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Stefan buzzed us into a five-storey building, a little the worse for wear. The entrance hall was cluttered with furniture and boxes. With no lift in evidence, we dragged our gear up flights of stairs admiring the scabrous garden through the broken windows at the mid-level landings when we paused to set our stuff down for a second. On level three Stefan showed us into his abode. As I went in I noticed a highball glass in his hand - he was already drinking. Well, it <em>was</em> nearly mid-morning. In we filed, the four of us, with eight pieces of luggage - some quite big indeed - into this tiny, single guy&#x2019;s flat. He was a youngish guy with a stylish haircut, or vice versa. There was an electric guitar lying by a computer with what looked like sound-recording software in the main room, which was the only room, really. That&#x2019;s right: on his profile there was something about composing rock operas in his spare time. &#x201C;Careful,&#x201D; he warned us. &#x201C;The cats never go out!&#x201D; Was this a command, or an observation?</p>","<p>&#x201C;Sorry, the place is a bit of a mess,&#x201D; he said. Anna&#x2019;s home seemed a long way away. He was one of those guys who spoke in an insinuating, knowing way, often with a smirk. My gaydar was lighting up. My gaydar operates at such a low resolution, like the first images they got from the Hubble Space Telescope, of fuzzy, barely discernible quasars and planetary nebulae before they fixed it, that when people set it off it&#x2019;s usually a sign that they&#x2019;re not gay in the slightest. So I guessed he wasn&#x2019;t gay. But he was wearing a leather waistcoat - did that mean something? He was separated and had kids. He looked young for his age.</p>","<p>&#x201C;You can use the kitchen any time you want,&#x201D; he said, knowingly.</p>","<p>I walked into the kitchen and, with barely a foot over the threshold, walked out again as if I&#x2019;d rebounded from a large, full-length plate glass partition I hadn&#x2019;t realised was there until I hit it with the front of my face. The kitchen would not be used by us, I decided. It was so bad that I wondered whether the reviews on couchsurfing that failed to mention its state weren&#x2019;t legally actionable. If we&#x2019;d known the kitchen was that atrocious we wouldn&#x2019;t have bothered him with a request. Being able to have breakfast and put sandwiches together before heading out for the day was economically vital.</p>","<p>It was painfully obvious we were not really the sorts of guests he&#x2019;d had in mind when he advertised on couchsurfing, nor was he an appropriate host for our needs. How were we to do this, then? I knew we&#x2019;d been spoiled by Nina and Anna, I&#x2019;d known it well. Spoiled by couchsurfing experiences in which we never had to sleep on couches, in short. But the degree to which we&#x2019;d had our unrealistic expectations violated here and now was beginning to hit me.</p>","<p>When I get stressed or anxious I get sleepy. It&#x2019;s a terrible adaptation, one whose benefits I can&#x2019;t begin to imagine. You&#x2019;d imagine that the tendency, in the teeth of a stressful situation, like, say, getting chased by a woolly mammoth or a raiding party of cavemen, to respond by wanting to put one&#x2019;s feet up for forty winks would have been selected out of the gene pool rapidly and spectacularly a long time ago somewhere in the Neander Valley. So it must be the accidental byproduct of a trait that confers some other advantage, like being tall or good at tying your shoelaces, and must have been accidentally coded for by a gene that just came along for the ride. Anyway, the prospect of spending the next few nights in Stefan&#x2019;s place made me start to fall asleep, ironically enough, on his couch.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Now - I have a question for you,&#x201D; he said, smirking.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D; Tina was handling things now. She&#x2019;s my rock.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Is it okay if I smoke?&#x201D; He raised his eyebrows in such an insinuating manner that one wondered what he was going to smoke. And what a strange question: it was his place, not ours. Still, it was dainty of him to ask.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, I suppose we&#x2019;d rather you didn&#x2019;t,&#x201D; said Tina, indicating Eoin and Alexander, and probably resenting being put in an awkward spot by Stefan, and left to fend for herself by me.</p>","<p>All this time, while pleasantries were being exchanged, several cats crawled all over our stuff and mewed constantly. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re&#x2026;hmmm&#x2026;how can I say this?&#x201D; Stefan insinuated, looking at Tina, and indicating Alexander and Eoin.</p>","<p>&#x201C;In heat?&#x201D; Tina said.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Yes, they&#x2019;re in heat, so they make a lot of noise.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;And they never leave the flat?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;No, never.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ok, well, I&#x2019;m sure they won&#x2019;t be a problem. Right, we should head out.&#x201D;</p>","<hr>","<p>A cold day, a dark day. Feeling a bit out of sorts, we took a tram to Oktagon, a junction between two main boulevards whose buildings have had their corners clipped, reminding us of the ones at many of the crossroads in Barcelona&#x2019;s Eixample district. We were in District VI, north inner city, and started up the impressive Andr&#xE1;ssy Boulevard.</p>","<p>We soon found ourselves in lock-step with a strange pedal-operated contraption, a table on wheels, operated by about eight or ten guys drinking and making quite a racket. They were pedalling furiously. And drinking even more so. The &#x2018;bike&#x2019; had a barrel at the front, and the funny thing was that for all they were exerting themselves they were hardly getting anywhere. It was as if something terrible would happen if they all stopped pedalling and drinking. The whole thing was a great offense to the eye, and to physics itself, but it was fun, both for onlookers and cyclists/drinkers. You see them everywhere now, but that was our first glimpse of a &#x2018;beer bike&#x2019;.</p>","<p>At Heroes Square we didn&#x2019;t feel like heroes. It was grey and freezing. There were impressive statues of the leaders of the seven tribes that founded Hungary. But we were worried about that night. Stefan&#x2019;s place just didn&#x2019;t suit us; we were beginning to realise we weren&#x2019;t so tough after all, with all our notions to just stay with strangers as if they were all just waiting to roll out a red carpet and listen to us witter on about our great plan to travel this way or that. Our mistake was to have ignored the clues on the couchsurfing website that must have been there, the ones that would have tipped off the astute traveller as to whether a place was right for them or not. No, we&#x2019;d grasped at a chance to stay somewhere for free rather than pay a small amount for somewhere that might actually suit us. Sadly, it wouldn&#x2019;t be the only time on our trip.</p>","<p>It reminded me of the same gamble I used to make when I went InterRailing as a youngster all those years ago: we (me and my friend Miche&#xE1;l) would pick evening train departure times for trips joining cities far from each other - say, Paris and Basle - that would allow us sleep for the duration of the journey, and arrive fresh as a daisy first thing in the morning, ready to wreck a new town. That particular wheeze came unstuck a few times when we couldn&#x2019;t find any spare compartments and spent the night slumped on our backpacks in the corridors, arriving about as fresh as the socks in the plastic dirty washing bags in our backpacks. That&#x2019;s how I saw a few cities back then in the glorious and terrible mornings of my youth, excited and shattered. I remember walking around Paris like a zombie, falling asleep on the <em>premiere &#xE9;tage</em> of the Eiffel Tower. I&#x2019;m a bit too old for that mullarkey now though, and Alexander and Eoin aren&#x2019;t old enough for it.</p>","<p>But maybe all this consternation and doubt was okay - we were learning our way. And Stefan was actually a nice guy. He&#x2019;d invited us for a drink tonight, in fact. He was meeting a couple of friends in a bar around the corner. Would we like to come along? Considering we were here, in Budapest, in Europe, to meet people, we said we would, thanks.</p>","<p>I had a quick shower back at his place, impressed at the number of business shirts hanging in there, almost like he had created a high-concept art installation, recreating a jungle, whose creeper vines were shirts and club ties. Someone should let Charles Saatchi know about this bathroom, I thought, as I warmed up under the steaming water.</p>","<p>Locking the cats up in their known universe, the apartment they never left, he took us to a tiny bar a few blocks away where we sat under the television and hung out with his friends. They were good eggs. They chatted to us in English, a chat the contents of which I am totally at a loss to remember, which is good. It means things went well. The boys watched football on the TV. After a pint we took our leave, leaving Stefan there with his friends and the football. Walking back through the neighbourhood we were glad we&#x2019;d gone along.</p>","<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the the first pub we&#x2019;ve been in since the night we went to Musikverein.&#x201D;</p>","<p>On level three, nicely tired now and prepared to brave the cats and the squalor we carefully opened Stefan&#x2019;s door. That&#x2019;s when our problems started. A thing that was supposed to <em>not</em> come out - one of the cats - did, and ran past us in a blur of horny black fur down the stairs. &#x201C;Huh? But the cats never go out!&#x201D; I said, dumbfounded. &#x201C;Ah! It was a command!&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; said Tina.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Never mind. You go and get the cat, I&#x2019;ll try and get the key out.&#x201D; The thing that was <em>supposed</em> to come out - the key - wouldn&#x2019;t. &#x201C;Boys, just go inside and wait for us. Don&#x2019;t go in the kitchen!&#x201D;</p>","<p>While I struggled with the key, I remembered him saying alright earlier on that there was &#x2018;knack&#x2019; to getting it out again. There&#x2019;s a knack to flying a plane as well, I thought, turning the thing every way and pulling, terrified of snapping it off. Meanwhile, downstairs, the cat had taken refuge in a storage room that may well have been designed expressly to hide fugitive cats. A kindly neighbour saw Tina&#x2019;s struggle and tried to help, but the cat wasn&#x2019;t for turning. I went down to see how she was getting on.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t get the key out. How&#x2019;re you doing?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t get the cat out. I&#x2019;m going to have to go back to the bar and get Stefan out.&#x201D;</p>","<p>He wasn&#x2019;t amused, ol&#x2019; Stefan, at having to walk back to the flat he&#x2019;d trusted the inept couchsurfers to manage on their own. Possessing the knack, he managed to get the key out, which at least meant that we could at some stage close the door behind us. He then went into the dark storage area to get his cat, a cat which never leaves the apartment, apparently.</p>","<p>I left them to it and went to supervise the boys and get ready to go to bed. They had already turned in, and I went to do the same but found that one of the cats had vomited on my bed. Neither Tina or I slept much that night. A cat would jump up, we&#x2019;d sleepily wave a hand in a dismissive flourish, like the Queen might, visiting a regional town, and the cat would jump down again. Up and down, up and down, the cats tramped over our bed like the crusaders over the Hungarian plains a millenium ago, only these cats were more of a nuisance. On the uncomfortable sofa bed, with bits sticking in my back and inadequate and - I suspected - unwashed sheeting, I waited, half sleeping, until eventually, and with great reluctance, given the state of the place, sunlight entered the flat, and I got up and had a nice shower. Not before dealing with some turds that one of the cats, I can only hope and assume, left for me in the bath. After that we stole quietly out of Stephan&#x2019;s flat.</p>","<p>Convening an emergency plenary family counsel in the only place open at eight, the curiously-named Mesterbike + Coffee Project, a bike shop cum caf&#xE9;, hadn&#x2019;t been how I&#x2019;d imagined tomorrow starting yesterday, but a decision needed to be made today. And in the matter of the first item on the agenda - not staying in Stefan&#x2019;s place any longer - we were a family unanimous. It was then just a matter of waiting till lunchtime, or whenever he surfaced, to announce our decision, thank him profusely, and leave. In the meantime, Tina found the worst apartment in Budapest for us to stay in. I&#x2019;m not being judgmental here: that was its name on Airbnb: &#x201C;The Worst Apartment in Budapest&#x201D;. That clever piece of reverse psychology worked. We were booked in for 2:30 this afternoon. We stole back in and quietly read, waiting for our host to wake up.</p>","<p>When he finally got up and presented himself, he was surprised to see us packed and ready to leave. It&#x2019;s not an easy thing telling someone you don&#x2019;t want to stay with them anymore, and I probably talked much more than I should have. He looked a little taken aback at first, but he came around.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I shouldn&#x2019;t have accepted you,&#x201D; he said.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, we pushed you. You knew what it would be like, and we should have listened.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;But you had nowhere to stay.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll find somewhere. In fact, we&#x2019;ve found a place.&#x201D;</p>","<p>I opened one of our suitcases and fetched out a small fluffy koala and a true blue Aussie pen, which sported a flag and southern cross - our standard tokens of gratitude. I felt a pang of remorse leaving the koala in there with the libidinous cats and actually considered stealing it back two minutes later, but travel had hardened me. We made our farewells, picked up our bags, ushered Alexander and Eoin out, and walked out with mixed feelings. Out on the pavement the heavens opened above us. Our Malaysian suitcase was on its last legs. But we had a new place to go.</p>","<p>A thought occurred to me, however: what if the name &#x2018;The Worst Apartment in Budapest&#x2019; wasn&#x2019;t reverse psychology?</p>"],["<p>I remember reading the Google CEO, Eric Schmidt, claiming that wars would soon be a thing of the past we would teach our increasingly incredulous kids about, now that Google Translate gave people the ability to understand each other in more or less real time, a similar claim, I also remember, to one made by the inventors of the telegram not long before World War I, funnily enough, since that particular technology gave countries the ability to communicate with each other in more or less real time, reducing - it was hoped - the likelihood of them acting aggressively towards each other out of ignorance and suspicion of each others&#x2019; intentions. Such grandiose claims. Google Translate did, however, allow the mother of the guy who owned The Worst Apartment in Budapest to communicate with us at her son&#x2019;s place. She set her laptop on the kitchen table and fired up GT. We found it easier to act out whatever questions we had. Whatever about preventing wars, miming taking a shower to an elderly Hungarian woman will be just one of the casualties of the brave new world of deep learning machine translation when we can all just type our conversations into a laptop, and it&#x2019;ll be a poorer future for it.</p>","<hr>","<p>Waiting at a place called <em>De&#xE1;k Ferenc t&#xE9;r</em> at the no.16 bus stop, we were overwhelmed by a group of Italians being rounded up and corralled onto the bus by their overworked tour guides. <em>Buona fortuna</em> trying to corral a <em>gruppo</em> of Italians, I thought, not knowing anything about Italians, but imagining for some reason that they must be hard to corral. I was hoping we&#x2019;d be able to make Italy at some stage on this trip, but I knew it wouldn&#x2019;t be this side of Ireland, so to speak, if we did. All I knew about the country that had given the world espresso coffee and Pinocchio was the day I&#x2019;d spent in Venice as an InterRailer, a day in which I&#x2019;d been given bubblegum and liquorish sweets as change in lieu of the actual currency of the country when I&#x2019;d bought a postcard, as mobile phones were called in those days. And here at the bus stop I stood aside, fascinated anew, and watched the Italians squeeze on to the tiny no. 16. It was like the last helicopter out of Saigon, but they did it, they all got on. We got the next helicopter, which was also crowded. Inside the bus matter achieved a higher than normal density, creating an environment conducive to spontaneous reactions between particles. A woman in a red rainjacket heard us talking to the kids and asked us where we were from.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Australia.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh, that&#x2019;s why you speak relatively good English. We&#x2019;re from Philadelphia, PA.&#x201D;</p>","<p>She was actually living in Dublin, had been for 15 years, to a financier from Glenamaddy, and had an easygoing vivacity which made me want to keep talking to her. The Glenamaddy man himself popped his head out to say hello from behind her parents who were also wearing brightly coloured raingear. Americans always wear brightly coloured raingear, I&#x2019;ve found.</p>","<p>&#x201C;How&#x2019;s the Great Barrier Reef?&#x201D; he asked, in a voice that still sounded west of Ireland.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve been to Queensland. We went to Lizard Island.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never heard of Lizard Island, but it sounds very Australian alright.&#x201D;</p>","<p>The weather at the top of the hill wasn&#x2019;t, on the other hand, very Australian (in the sense of being very good, as - in my experience, at least - Australian weather tends to be). Melburnian, maybe. Our little <em>gruppo</em> set off for one of the best museums we would end up seeing on our entire trip, and that&#x2019;s saying something: the <em>Budapesti T&#xF6;rt&#xE9;nati</em> (History) <em>M&#xFA;zeum</em>. I was delighted to see Alexander occupy himself by standing in front of some of the exhibits and taking notes. The two boys were both at an age now where they were beginning to show an interest in history, if not culture in general, or - heaven forbid - other countries&#x2019; food.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Is that your kid drawing things?&#x201D; this old-timer American asked me.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ah, hello again.&#x201D;</p>","<p>I found myself walking around at the same pace and on the same trajectory as the Philadelphian woman&#x2019;s father, an old boy in his &#x2018;70s. I liked him; he&#x2019;d been around. We stood side by side in front of the displays of war memorabilia, both awed by the relentless violence and destruction visited upon Budapest in one form or another - natural, tribal, fascistic, and finally communistic - since the earliest people had settle on those particular banks of the Danube. I was especially struck by the fact that the Nazis, besieged by the advancing Russians at the end of WWII, managed to do what the Austrians tried and failed to do one hundred years earlier: blow up the iconic L&#xE1;nch&#xED;d, the Chain Bridge. In fact they blew up all of Budapest&#x2019;s bridges. Did that mean that these fine icons of Hungary were actually replicas? It did. Worse things happened in Budapest&#x2019;s history, naturally, but you read so much about the first bridge to connect Buda and Pest, and how it drove economic progress and helped unify the country, that it&#x2019;s a surprise to learn that the current incumbent is a facsimile. The bridge rebuilding project was one of the first things to happen after the war, however, and in the event the L&#xE1;nch&#xED;d was only out of commission for four years.</p>","<p>We sat that evening in the Worst Apartment&#x2019;s small bay window area, reading the NY Times &#x2018;36 hours in Budapest&#x2019; book that was left for visitors, and looked up every now and then at the people below on Nap street struggling with their umbrellas. There were bullet holes on the walls of the buildings across the street from us dating from the uprising. The apartment wasn&#x2019;t as bad as it was made out to be. And at &#x20AC;30 a night it was a steal. Despite its claims to the contrary, there were in all likelihood worse apartments to be in. There were obtuse angles and interesting stains. Emerging from the stairway onto the mezzanine walkway to our apartment on the second floor, a courtyard opened up below us with plenty of washing hanging out, bicycles leaning, and dormant ivy ascending the walls. A mother and daughter seemed to live next door to us on one side. I looked in a broken window on the other side and saw someone working quietly away in there, fixing the place up, probably for more Airbnbers like us. But it was quiet. Conditions were perfect for writing a Kafkaesque novel.</p>","<p>The kitchen, though, was poorly provisioned. We didn&#x2019;t need a box of matches; we didn&#x2019;t need a candle-holder. What we needed was a corkscrew. I couldn&#x2019;t believe we didn&#x2019;t have one in all our stuff. Too used to screw-tops, like all Australians. I was determined that first evening to celebrate our change of fortune, but sadly I broke the top of the wine bottle trying to get the cork out with a spoon. Filtering that 600 forint pish with a noodle strainer, I looked up and saw Alexander and Eoin looking at me.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Hey, we&#x2019;re in our own place, lads!&#x201D; I said raising my cup.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Why are you drinking wine out of a teacup?&#x201D; said Eoin.</p>","<p>&#x201C;With a spoon,&#x201D; said Alexander.</p>","<p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter what you drink wine out of when you&#x2019;re happy!&#x201D; I said. &#x201C;Want some?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;No thanks Dad.&#x201D;</p>","<p>The Worst Bath in Budapest listed several degrees. Being in it was, I imagine (from watching movies like <em>The Poseidon Adventure</em> and <em>Titanic</em>), like being in a stricken ship at the beginning of the end, and the creaks and groans from the wooden floor straining to carry the cast-iron load made it feel as if at any moment it would just plunge through the floor into the abyss, or at least the lap of the woman watching TV in the flat below. Very close to me, worryingly so, given my nudity, somebody was singing somewhere in the building. Such musical activity, involving as it does reverberations, would not have been a good idea in this bath where the trick was to move as little as possible and avoid the destabilising effects of things like noise. I don&#x2019;t often allow myself the luxury of having a bath, but when I do I like to relax. This bath wasn&#x2019;t like that. With this bath I only began relaxing when I got out.</p>","<p>Ready for bed, I struggled with the stiff tension release mechanism of the Worst Blinds in Budapest for a while, getting increasingly frustrated at their recalcitrance, when suddenly the fitting came out of the wall and rained bits of plaster on my upturned face. <em>Ooh, that&#x2019;s going in the review,</em> I said to myself, picking chunks of plaster out of my eyebrows. I suddenly realised why all my life I&#x2019;ve had heavy, thick eyebrows. It was all for this moment, here on Nap Street, Budapest. Good job, lads.</p>","<p>We turned in, sitting up in bed reading. &#x201C;Not a bad place now, &#x201D; I offered.</p>","<p>&#x201C;No, not bad at all,&#x201D; Tina acquiesced.</p>","<p>I was probably about to repeat that it wasn&#x2019;t a bad place at all when some jerry-built supporting plank somewhere in the bed suddenly gave way, dropping us straight back abruptly and leaving us staring at the ceiling.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m looking forward to Greece, all the same.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Me too,&#x201D; said Tina.</p>","<hr>","<p>As a postscript, I wrote to Bela about the blinds. &#x201C;Hi Bela, I&#x2019;m sorry, we seem to have broken one of the blinds/shutters, the one in the main bedroom. We couldn&#x2019;t work out how to use them - the one over the single bed doesn&#x2019;t seem to work at all - so we pulled the fitting out of the wall accidentally. They way they work is unfamiliar to us, so we must have been pulling the wrong cord, sorry.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;First of April&#x2019;s joke?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;No, why would I joke about that?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Because it is first of April. But if it is not a joke then what can we do. Do not worry somebody will fix it. Regards, Bela&#x201D;.</p>","<p>I didn&#x2019;t like to leave it like that, me trashing his gaff and him having to fix it. I thought of writing &#x2018;Say hi to your Mum&#x2019;, but something told me I should keep her out of it. He might have been one of those hot-blooded types that gets funny about their Mum. I could never relate to all that posturing and antics. You can say what you want about my Mum; it doesn&#x2019;t bother me because whatever you said would be untrue and it&#x2019;d only be yourself you&#x2019;d be disgracing. Unless, of course, you were referring to the time in the early 60&#x2019;s when she used to go to Spain on holidays and act the floozy, in which case it probably would be true.</p>","<p>Bela was right - it was the first of April. I hadn&#x2019;t noticed in all the excitement. It was time to leave Budapest, a city in which we&#x2019;d struggled to replicate the cosiness of a warm, well-stocked basement in Vienna. We&#x2019;d found it in Anna&#x2019;s, lost it in Stefan&#x2019;s, and found it again in the worst apartment in Budapest.</p>"]]},{"index":3,"title":"Διονύσιος Κοριανήτις street","pages":[["<p>Unlike Ulysses, who got around on triremes, ca&#xEF;ques, and the occasional raft, we caught a Ryanair, the first direct Budapest-Athens flight of spring, and then a coach, to our Greek island home. Zakynthos is one of the seven or so islands in the Ionian Sea, the body of water on the Italian side of Greece, and lies south of the better-known destinations of Corfu and Cephalonia, although its own fame is growing by the season. Nowadays, in fact, it&#x2019;s overrun with English, Irish, Germans, Bulgarians, Loggerhead turtles, Poles and Italians - sunseekers from every nook of Europe except Portugal and Spain, who of course are also overrun by those same sunseekers, and even by the turtles.</p>","<p>Zante (as Zakynthos is also known) has served as our base in the Mediterranean over the past decade or so on our trips back to Europe, which we tried to make every two years. After paying tribute to Mum back in Dublin and squeezing in whatever flying side trip to France or Spain we could afford with whatever change was left over from four tickets from Australia to Ireland, we always managed to spend a couple of weeks on Zante before heading home to Australia.</p>","<p>Tina&#x2019;s parents, Yiayia and Pappou (&#x2018;Granny&#x2019; and &#x2018;Grandad&#x2019;), grew up on the island, and experienced the Italian occupation of their beloved island, then the German one, but it was the great earthquake of &#x2018;53 that proved the last straw for them. They emigrated from Zante to Australia soon after; first Pappou, who ended up at Bonegilla Migrant Camp in rural Victoria - Ned Kelly country - just one of the third of a million migrants who passed through the camp in the mid-twentienth century. The endless diet of rabbit might have been familiar but the mutton would have been a shock, and in fact riots broke out in the camp over the food until order, and spaghetti, was brought about courtesy of the Italian cooks they got in. He was followed down under two years later by Yiayia. They got married by arrangement in Newcastle, New South Wales. Too busy raising a family and working all the hours, they only started coming back regularly to Zakynthos forty years later; a different century, a different country. Though both were still fit and relatively active, to make life easier for themselves they had a handsome two-storey house built on the site of the bockety old family shack Yiayia&#x2019;s family used to summer in when they were kids growing up on the island. No more than two hundred yards from the nearest beach, we all called it &#x2018;Koukla House&#x2019; since Porto Koukla is the name of the area (and also because &#x2018;Koukla&#x2019; means &#x2018;pretty&#x2019;, or &#x2018;doll&#x2019;). It&#x2019;s our pretty little European pied-&#xE0;-terre.</p>","<p>Once on the island we try to avoid heatwaves, forest fires, inexpertly-ridden quad bikes (which here are called &#x2018;<em>gourounakia</em>&#x2019;, which means &#x2018;piggies&#x2019;), and, if we were still there in September, being shot at by the army of camouflaged fowl assassins during hunting season - just long enough to get into the swing of things but not long enough to bother fully emptying our suitcase, which we&#x2019;d usually just leave against the wall of the bedroom and operate out of. On this happy occasion, however, suitcases would duly be emptied and undies would duly go in drawers. Lighter apparel would be donned now that Spring was coming, and the heavy jackets and jumpers that protected us on the banks of the Danube would not be required.</p>","<p>On the island there would be precious little weeding in hard, tiny gardens with numbed fingers, no incorrect dishwasher loading (since we didn&#x2019;t have one), few if any English grammar classes to speak of, a bare minimum of freezing our arses off on train platforms with the howling winds from the Alps whipping down the tracks. Not was it envisaged that time would be wasted traipsing around putting teabags, tins, and tetrapaks in separate recycling containers, or hanging out laundry - clean, or dirty - that wasn&#x2019;t our own. And hopefully, there&#x2019;d be fewer priapic felines keeping us awake at night. Wiener melanges would give way to frapp&#xE9;s as the caffeine delivery medium of choice. We had served our time in basements, attics and decrepit flats, and now our lives were starting to take on a sky-blue, hellenic tint. The boys were growing up by the day. Daffodils were blossoming by the side of the roads and the bees were <em>voueezeeing</em>. Greek bees don&#x2019;t &#x2018;buzz&#x2019;, you see.</p>","<p>There would be none of the baroque clutter of Austria, Germany, Slovakia, or Hungary. Our lives would become simple. Koukla House has a balcony which faces out across Laganas Bay, which is bordered on the north by the mountainous Vasilikos peninsula. Immediately I started spending a lot of time sitting out on the balcony looking at both of those things. When the sun rose each morning, it appeared to us (if we got up in time) as a growing pressure of light behind the top of the northernmost point on the peninsula before exploding over the top in a piercing, stinging flood of light. It&#x2019;s fair to say that in our basement in the suburbs, and every subsequent place we&#x2019;d stayed up to then, we&#x2019;d been completely cut off from nature&#x2019;s cycles. Before, the giant clock of the seasons was like a digital clock, one whose reckoning was opaque. Here, the very mechanism of time was exposed to us in the clearest terms.</p>","<p>One morning shortly after arriving I got an email from Donaustadt. Sarah had sent me a copy of Mara&#x2019;s English <em>Schulerarbeit</em> results. There in young Mara&#x2019;s handwriting was our story about Jeremy the crow, which she had learned by heart to be able to recite it for her English exam.</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Ralph, Thanks for your help with English. See the result in the attachment :) And thanks a lot for your (HelpExchange) review. You are welcome in our house whenever your plans allow you to come back.</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>That made my day. We had expected, like I said, to end up cleaning out bins and unloading dishwashers as Help Exers, but not to contribute to a young girl&#x2019;s education. But before we could settle in too comfortably in Koukla House we had some educational business closer to home to attend to. It was one thing for me and Tina to pull the plug on our careers and leave the country to taste the sweet nectar of freedom, but we had taken the boys out of school. Whenever we&#x2019;d described our plans for our big trip to friends and colleagues back in Brisbane they&#x2019;d always asked us &#x201C;How can you just do that?&#x201D; What they meant was: &#x201C;How can you just take your children out of school like that? Isn&#x2019;t that illegal?&#x201D; It is in Germany and Austria, we discovered. It isn&#x2019;t in Australia.</p>","<p>Such a great country, &#x2018;Straya. You hear a lot of guff about it being &#x2018;a nanny state&#x2019;, but one reason our big trip was even possible in the first place was because the Commonwealth trusted us, the boys&#x2019; parents, to know what was best for them. If you wanted to spend time with your kids on the boulevards and plazas of Europe, well then, onya mate, catcha later. The teachers knew us and knew that the boys&#x2019; absence wouldn&#x2019;t be the result of malfeasance or fecklessness on our behalf. On the other hand Alexander and Eoin wouldn&#x2019;t get the full education they needed in the museums of Vienna, Bratislava, and Budapest, great as they were. You can&#x2019;t live on air, even the refined air of high European culture, and kids can&#x2019;t thrive if they don&#x2019;t know how to learn. So the day after arriving in Zakynthos we arranged for Alexander and Eoin to attend the small village school that served Koukla and the neighbouring villages.</p>","<p>Even though we&#x2019;d talked about it with them, and it had always been part of the plan, packing their bags and bringing them to school on the first morning after the Easter break was a shock for all of us. We&#x2019;d spent virtually every waking minute of the trip up to that moment in their company. In a rude encroachment of real life into our trip, they&#x2019;d have to be schooled here, in Greek, for the next two months. On their first morning we stood there for roll call and watched Alexander and Eoin turn and walk, separately, in single file down their own corridors, disappearing each into a class full of kids they didn&#x2019;t know, there to obey teachers speaking a language they&#x2019;d better pick up quickly.</p>"],["<p>We woke up every morning to days fat with time. Like astronauts on a fast rocket, time began to slow down for us. We aged less than those we&#x2019;d left behind. The germ of an idea had started to take shape in my head a few months before leaving Australia: maybe I could write a book. Now I had my chance. I&#x2019;d probably never have this much free time again in my life. As fun and as life-shaping as our journey hopefully would be, I didn&#x2019;t want the memory of it to fade once we got home and had to start leaving out the bins again. Could I do it, though? I&#x2019;d been writing articles for our travel blog, KouklaHouse.com, so I knew I could sit down and knock out a thousand or so words every couple of weeks. The trick now on Zante was to write seventy thousand of them over a couple of months. I cleared a space on a small table by the window overlooking the garden (the artichokes along the fence were coming along nicely), flipped open the laptop, and started writing.</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>&#x201C;We entered Z&#xE1;kynthos through the front door, riding in on the waves, boots up on the gunwale, telescopes out&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>Then I wrote a second sentence, then a third&#x2026; I kept that up, sentence after sentence, day after day, until I believed I&#x2019;d discovered the secret to writing a book, right there in Koukla House, on &#x394;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3CD;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; &#x39A;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3AE;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C2; street. And that last part of that last sentence was a problem I ran into almost immediately. To what extent should I use Greek words in their original form? (I never solved that problem.)</p>","<p>Now I had worked out what to do with my time I could get on with living out my Greek island fantasy. Tina baked <em>spanakopitas</em> and lemon pies. With a fantastic guidebook to Zakynthos we&#x2019;d found that treated the island as something more than just a beach destination we planned walks to Venetian-era wells and hard-to-find remains of German army gun emplacements. We took advantage of the boys&#x2019; absence to walk through villages surrounded by the olive trees and Aleppo pines that cover large parts of the island. Walks where groves and churches were just excuses to follow trails with sudden, dramatic sea views. In the evenings, with the heater beside me, I wrote.</p>","<p>These were heady days to be in Greece. And not just because the orchids and rock roses were everywhere erupting in colour. The country was lurching from one political crisis to another. Greece couldn&#x2019;t afford to pay back the money it had borrowed from the EU, so the EU lent Greece some more to help it pay the first lot back, what economists call (or should do) &#x2018;Boys from the County Hell&#x2019; economics, from the Pogues song with the line (sure we may as well have both lines):</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>And it&#x2019;s lend me ten pounds, I&#x2019;ll buy you a drink,\nand mother wake me early in the morning</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>Now, we love Greece, but the Greeks think the world revolves around them, and maybe they&#x2019;re right. But <em>i crisi</em>, as the crisis was called there, was hard to overstate. Whenever I&#x2019;d hear some friend we&#x2019;d bumped into or relative we were visiting bemoan the uniquely cruel fate of the country in overwrought terms you had to remember that Greece&#x2019;s was the biggest financial rescue of a bankrupt country in history. If the rest of the world ever thought of the year 2060, they&#x2019;d think of a world of self-driving cars, fleets of tiny sailed spacecraft on their way to explore distant stars having been accelerated to half the speed of light by lasers, and drones dropping off pizzas to people on the two-hundred and eighty-fifth floor of a skyscraper the shape of a Rubik&#x2019;s snake. Greeks, on the other hand, would wonder if the debt repayments scheduled to continue till that year would actually have been paid off by then.</p>","<p>Something like a third of the population was living below the poverty line. Some of the people who lived near us certainly looked like they might be in that segment. We weren&#x2019;t really in any position to help anyone out, other than to buy their eggs or whatever they were selling, small things like that. We relied as much as we could on the local baker and the convenience shop (which had everything) rather than on Lidl or Spar. But Yiorgo, that obstinate man, kept bringing us food, and even our family friend Taso, who owned a four-star, all-inclusive hotel by the beach, just told us to help ourselves to the buffet whenever we visited him. Greek hospitality was stifling. You couldn&#x2019;t give these people anything! Unless it was &#x20AC;240bn, in which case they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to pay it back.</p>","<p>In the distance, over the watery eastern horizon, even beyond the Peloponnese, on the far side of Greece and in the train stations of Balkan towns, another crisis was intensifying. Greece was starting to overtake Italy as the first port of call within the EU for migrants. That first month we spent on our own the number of people who died fleeing the violence in Syria reached a new high. On cool but clear afternoons we would sit on the beds of Neptune grass washed up on the beach the tourists hadn&#x2019;t started coming to yet and we&#x2019;d read, occasionally looking up to think about those poor so-and-sos in their flimsy boats, and to reflect on how lucky we were. We had hardly any money to speak of, but we had all this. We had travelled for pleasure, not for our lives.</p>","<hr>","<p>The summer was coming. You could hear it. The tavernas were beginning to open up and every one of them we walked past radiated music, with its signature mandolins and bouzoukis, that just tickled our ears. In such an orchestra I felt it would have been a real shame not to join in. We asked around in a couple of music shops in town and got some phone numbers. Eventually I met a guy, a heavy-set, bald, middle-aged guy of commanding presence who ran a <em>mandolinada</em>, a music group, in the village of Lithaki&#xE1;, conveniently close to us.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Can you read music?&#x201D; he asked me.</p>","<p>&#x201C;No. Slowly. If I have ages.&#x201D; I could read music like I could read Greek. I knew what the individual symbols meant, but making them make sense made me tired. He looked at me sternly. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ll have to pick it up really quickly.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Feeling like a complete imposter I sat in one evening with ten or so boys and girls, men and women, as they played on bouzoukis, guitars, and mandolins in a small community centre. Some songs were traditional, some were new, written by the Maestro himself (as I called the organiser), and some were the theme from <em>The Godfather</em>. It was a well-drilled outfit, this <em>mandolinada</em>, and the music they made in that little room full of badly-framed historical (i.e. grossly inaccurate) maps of the island was effortlessly, timelessly Greek. When Mum came over in June she sat in on a couple of occasions and recorded the songs on my tablet so I could go over them in my own time. More used to being taken out to tavernas and beaches, she was thrilled to be part of my musical adventure.</p>","<p>We paid a woman to come to the house and teach the kids Greek, and sometimes I&#x2019;d do a quick half hour with her when she was finished with them. In Germany Tina and I had tried our best to learn German. In Hungary there was no point. Here in Greece I got back into Greek. I&#x2019;d studied it before, and Tina could speak it fluently, from speaking it to her parents from day one. So I bought a novel and read it. It took an inordinate amount of time to finish but guess what? - yep, I had that time.</p>","<p>As time ticked on and the spring breezes gave way to warmer days and longer evenings I tried to put out of my mind the day when I&#x2019;d have to find a job in Ireland if we wanted the journey to keep going into next year. We had no ticket home to Australia booked, but at the rate our money was running out we thought it unlikely we&#x2019;d make it much past Christmas if we hadn&#x2019;t struck employment by then. I had to get a job in Dublin, and since the prospect horrified me I gave it no thought. I didn&#x2019;t read a single web development blog nor work on any home projects, either of which would have helped me stay in the game. Because I&#x2019;d found a new game: writing. The old game, the one that paid our way, bored me. In a totally unexpected godsend, however, our finances received a shot in the arm from an unlikely source one day, in the form of an email:</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>You are being contacted by the GoDaddy Domain Buy Service team. We have a client interested in purchasing a domain name you own. Please click the link below to view our client&#x2019;s initial offer.</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>I clicked. Three thousand euros. Strangely, it was a genuine offer. Over the next few days I held out for a slightly higher offer (never quite believing it) and sold the domain name for about four and a half thousand euros, at which point I believed the offer. I&#x2019;d bought that particular domain name to promote my portal site about Connemara, on the west coast of Ireland, some eighteen years earlier for the sum of around one hundred punts. Good ol&#x2019; pre-euro Irish punts. With that few extra bob in the bank we could breathe easier. Actually, if all went well, we&#x2019;d be in Connemara later that year. For one thing, my brother still lived there. But more to the point, and I say that because on a long trip like ours money is always the point, we still had a house there, the first one Tina and I had bought upon returning to Connemara after getting married in Australia. That had to go too if we were to remain solvent. This trip, indeed, could well end up with the name &#x2018;The Everything Must Go Grand Tour&#x2019;.</p>"],["<p>Imagine sitting opposite someone at a taverna table. Imagine they put their right hand flat on the table. They could use their left to nurse a frapp&#xE9;, or play with some <em>komboloi</em> (worry beads), or move a backgammon piece, but it&#x2019;s their right hand we&#x2019;re interested in. Now imagine they joined their pinky and ring fingers in a half Vulcan salute, but left the others relaxed. Can you see that? That&#x2019;s the Peloponnese. It looks a bit like a hand.</p>","<p>The kids were finished up in school and Mum had gone back home, so we thought we&#x2019;d do a ten-day driving tour of the Peloponnese now we&#x2019;d received some unexpected funds. We just hoped the country didn&#x2019;t collapse while we were away, stranding us far from Koukla House. ATMs were rumoured to be running out of money and petrol stations out of petrol. We checked and found that unlike the wretched locals, who were restricted to &#x20AC;50 or so per day, we were able to get money out since our cards were issued by Australian banks. But that mightn&#x2019;t last too long the way things were going.</p>","<p>On a fair morn and clear, we caught the first ferry to the knuckle of the pinky - Killini. We sat inside with our guidebook, planning a Homeric tour of this ancient terrain, going out onto the deck occasionally to monitor our progress towards the Kastro on the hill overlooking Killini. Down the pinky in our hired car we went in the harsh sunlight, down to the ancient site of Messene, which we had to ourselves, then to Pylos, where we found out about the Battle of Navarino. At the tip of the little finger, Methoni Castle felt like the end of the world, which it certainly was to the Venetians slaughtered there.</p>","<p>The middle finger of the hand is Mani, which is fitting. This prickly, untameable land is where the word &#x2018;maniac&#x2019; comes from. It&#x2019;s known its fair share of &#x2018;Fuck you!&#x2019;, &#x2018;No, fuck you!&#x2019; tribal feuds over the years. Geographically we were very far from anything, halfway down the Mani, but as soon as we checked the news on our phones or as much as glanced up at a TV in a taverna, the panicky feeling prevailing throughout the country reached us. No matter that you were in a guesthouse in Kardamyli, in your walled-in garden with a low covered well in Monemvasia, the spectacular walled city on a rock halfway down the index finger, or even in a caf&#xE9; in Sparta, the TV screen or social media would find you and scream the word Grexit at you.</p>","<p>The highlight of our Peloponnese trip was the Lousios Gorge, in Arcadia, with its monks&#x2019; quarters down at the bottom of the gorge, built high up into the cliff-face, and the breathtaking views up and down the gorge from on high, where you would hardly know there was anything below you.</p>","<p>The Saturday night after we got back the anti-EU passion climaxed with a referendum of dubious legitimacy (as far as the rest of the EU was concerned) in which Greece raised a Mani-shaped middle-finger to The Man (or should I say Der Mann) and his program of austerity. But it all meant nothing. It was like watching a nation vote against earthquakes. We watched it at home on TV wondering what it all meant. The answer was: nothing whatsoever. Despite the wild scenes of celebration in Athens the Greek parliament passed the austerity measures it was always bound to pass two weeks later. And so Greece hung on, and talk of Grexit never reached that level of intensity again. But our time on the island was up.</p>","<p>We packed our bags a couple of days layer. I returned the guitar I&#x2019;d borrowed to the Maestro and saved my fifty-thousand-or-so word long document containing my book so far into the cloud, the only cloud you&#x2019;d see those perfect days. We covered the furniture with sheets, swept the balcony, and shed a tear to be leaving Zakynthos. We knew we&#x2019;d never be that free again.</p>","<p>But we&#x2019;d found a new way to live and made different types of friends from the ones we normally had. Food had become simpler. The kids had adapted to school, I&#x2019;d joined a mandolin and bouzouki group, and we&#x2019;d eaten in tavernas in the hills with my Mum. We&#x2019;d even dressed up to take part in an fun Venetian-era jousting-era celebration (the <em>Joustra</em>) and paraded through town. And we&#x2019;d walked the hills on crisp, sunny mornings before cutting through the groves to pick up the boys from school.</p>","<p>Our next episode was to stay with a family in a coastal town in Poland called Ko&#x142;obrzeg, which we&#x2019;d never heard of before and couldn&#x2019;t even begin to pronounce. We&#x2019;d wanted to prolong the journey as long as we could before reaching Ireland, and a Polish family who found us on Help Exchange had lured us north with the promise of camping. We were getting soft here on the beach, I&#x2019;d put on a bit of a belly with all the <em>krasi</em> (wine), and camping with hardened ex-communists in Poland might just be what we needed to keep our edge. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll show you austerity!&#x201D; I imagined them goading us.</p>","<p>It wouldn&#x2019;t be the easiest destination to get to: we&#x2019;d have to get there via Athens, then Berlin, the Athens on the Spree as it&#x2019;s known (by Germans, not by Greeks).</p>"]]},{"index":4,"title":"A Hotel-Pension off OlivaerPlatz","pages":[["<p>Berlin is a city of three-and-a-half million people, uncaring bastards all, indifferent to our requests to sleep on their couches for a mere three days and break bread together. And since that was much too short a span of time to expect anyone to take us in for a work exchange stay we hadn&#x2019;t bothered applying for anything on HelpEx. Accepting that for this interim between Greece and Poland we&#x2019;d just be quietly poking around town on our own, we booked a room in a Hotel-Pension in Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, west of the centre, near the Zoo. I looked up &#x2018;Hotel-Pension&#x2019; on Wikipedia to find out what made a hotel a pension or a pension a hotel but it was uncharacteristically silly on the matter: &#x201C;Pension hotels can be found in the Philippines and probably in other countries.&#x201D; I felt like adding to the sum of human knowledge by editing the page to confirm that there was one on Bregenzer Strasse too.</p>","<p>After Greece, we&#x2019;d been looking forward to a bit of German efficiency. We landed in Berlin Tegel airport to find the luggage carousel conveyor belt broken. For half an hour we all sat around while a couple of guys in hi-vis with outsize walkie talkies came and went and looked in and around the entrance of the chute but still, nothing passed but long minutes of angst. Of course, maybe Tegel wasn&#x2019;t getting the attention it needed because it should, after all, have been Withd six years earlier by the new Brandenburg airport, if only that hadn&#x2019;t been delayed due to poor construction planning, management, execution and corruption.</p>","<p>Having checked in to our Pension-Hotel I was in a better position to determine just what was it about it that was so &#x2018;pension&#x2019;-y. Well, for a start, despite being a large, four-storey terraced building, the first three floors had nothing to do with the hotel itself. They just had flats for ordinary, permanent, rent-paying punters. Or anarchist squatters, I don&#x2019;t know - this was Berlin, after all. But in any case, we had to get the lift up to the fourth floor to get to the hotel reception. Sadly for our newfound zeal to connect, there was no communal living area where one might fraternise with the other guests. They had a good book swap shelf though. I picked up Bill Bryon&#x2019;s <em>Neither Here Nor There: Travels in Europe</em> which I was delighted to find, as the man was doing exactly what I was doing: travelling around Europe and writing about it. If I can avoid becoming as cranky and bibulous as he always seemed to be I&#x2019;d be happy. Nor did our room have a balcony. With the four of us in the room and nowhere else to sit, I was going to spend a lot of time reading and watching Tour de France highlights at teatime before exploring, we imagined, the Japanese and Turkish restaurants around the neighbourhood for our evening perambulation.</p>","<p>We got out nonetheless and did the sights. I bought a copy of <em>Die Zeit</em> to try and bring my German back up to the low standard I&#x2019;d painstakingly got it up to four months earlier in Vienna. We also picked up the trashy <em>Heute</em> freebies you get outside the train stations. We didn&#x2019;t think they were the same ones we&#x2019;d got in Vienna, but it was hard to tell since they mainly consisted of the same type of celebrity puff pieces. As we were ferried around under Berlin, we struggled together, Tina and I, through rare non-celebrity pieces, such as snippets about the recently discovered planet called Kepler&#x2013;154 and about how Turkey was getting dragged more and more into the mess in Syria.</p>","<p>One of the first things we noticed out on the street was the dapper little man we&#x2019;d always see at the pedestrian crossings. No, not a well-dressed and elderly Kreuzberger waiting to cross the road for his morning Kaffee, I mean the actual character on the lights themselves, the character that goes green or red, telling you to walk or wait. This was Ampelmann, and Alexander and Eoin quickly took to him. In his red, &#x2018;don&#x2019;t walk&#x2019; state he looks like a Saturn-head being crucified, but in his green, &#x2018;walk&#x2019; state he strides vigorously forward, one giant arm thrusting westward. Ampelmann started out in East Berlin, and is one of the only things that people remember fondly from that era. Nowadays Ampelm&#xE4;nnchen are everywhere and even have their own chain of stores. Getting some Ampelmann notebooks, pencils, and rubbers was, for Alexander and Eoin, the highlight of Berlin. I took a photo of them standing outside the concert hall at Gendermenmarkt with their haul and sent it to the Maestro, not to make him or his kids jealous, but because he had slipped them each some money before we left and I wanted to register that in some way. Considering that he was basically a farmer from a small village in rural Greece (his own words), slipping the lads a pourboire like that had been above and beyond the call of duty. I wanted to show him that his generosity had bought Alexander and Eoin something special: Ampelm&#xE4;nnchenshwag!</p>","<p>We pressed on and saw the Reichstag (which I&#x2019;d actually been in once before, as a Russian infantryman at the end of one of the levels of Call of Duty) and continued our promenade through the Brandenburg Gate. Just a few blocks from the Gate is an abstract memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe, a grid of rectangular monoliths (stellae, if you really want to know) occupying an entire block. From the street from which we entered it the stellae were only knee-high. As you went further in they started to tower over us - Eoin being the first to disappear - and before long making us feel as if we were in a maze. That&#x2019;s not because the stellae were getting bigger but because the ground was sinking down. The boys were still a bit young then for a visit to the Gestapo Prison, so this outdoor abstraction would do, and it prompted us to tell them a little bit about what it stood for, wrapped up against the general backdrop of WWII, the broad outlines of which they were already familiar with.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Who wants to go to the Berlin Wall Memorial?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Not me.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve already been to that, Dad.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Not quite, Eoin. That was just a chunk of the old wall they left at Potsdamer platz.

Like the stupid locks on the bridge at Salzburg. Anyway, we&#x2019;re going to a place where&#x2026;where&#x2026;here, help me out Tina.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a street the wall used to be on, and now it&#x2019;s an outdoor museum. We have to get the U-Bahn though.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Dad?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Why did the ticket inspector on the train have blue hair and metal things in her face?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Because we&#x2019;re in Berlin. Now come on, let&#x2019;s go to the wall. <em>Raus!</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>It was a bleak, dreary memorial to the dreary old wall, but any museum that is outdoors and doesn&#x2019;t involve simply peering into glass cases is a welcome stop on a travelling family&#x2019;s itinerary. The memorial park up along Bernauer Strasse goes for one and a half kilometers running exactly where the wall was, which at the time split an existing community right down the middle. There are information boards lining the route explaining the development of the wall and how it affected the locals. The ghostly paths of tunnels were marked on the ground. Towards the end of the park the memorial contains the last piece of the Wall, with the preserved grounds behind it, so you can see what the border security was like. There was a Documentation Centre exhibition at the end which explained the political and historical situation that led to the Wall&#x2019;s construction, its fall, and the reunification of Germany.</p>","<p>We sat and watched the mini-documentary a few times. The press conference where the hapless G&#xFC;nter Schabowski announced the end of border controls between east and west; the crowds that very evening surrounding the befuddled security guards and demanding to be let through, then being let through, all of them surging through the Brandenburg Gate; the whistley bit at the beginning of &#x2018;Winds of Change&#x2019; - it got me every time. I could feel the tears well up. This wouldn&#x2019;t, however, be the only wall separating two communities living in the same city we&#x2019;d see on this trip.</p>"],["<p>Keen to connect and just say &#x201C;Guten Tag&#x201D; - or &#x201C;Juten tai&#x201D; as they sometimes pronounce it here - I got chatting to a plumpish young Wienerin early on a Sunday morning in the queue for the Museum Pergamon. She was studying IT and had come to town for a conference on AI but rather than head back to Vienna she&#x2019;d decided to stay an extra day and clear her head of the future by looking at the past. I liked that. She got me to take a photo of her inside in front of the Ischar Gate. We normally struggle to hold the boys&#x2019; attention in art galleries and museums but when it comes to reconstructions of ancient cities they&#x2019;re hooked. At the reconstruction of The Gate of Miletus they were so impressed that they announced that they were going to build this is Minecraft, the loftiest tribute they could pay.</p>","<p>Outside in the weak July sunshine again, I kept an eye out for the IT woman to ask her for a coffee, but there was no sign of her. I&#x2019;d gotten the impression she was a serious museum goer and wouldn&#x2019;t have just taken it in at walking pace like we did. The crowd had built up at this stage - people were queued up well past the &#x2018;1 Stunde&#x2019; marker, which meant it&#x2019;s be at least ninety minutes before they saw anything at all. Berlin in July.</p>","<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a pity we didn&#x2019;t meet that girl again,&#x201D; I said.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, I got a message from a woman called Gaby who&#x2019;s invited us to meet her if we want.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Who&#x2019;s she?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I wrote to her a while ago on couchsurfing and by the time she answered and said she couldn&#x2019;t put us up we&#x2019;d already booked the hotel. So I said thanks anyway, and now she&#x2019;s just written back.&#x201D; Tina showed me the message.</p>","<p><em>&gt;&#x201C;Would love to have you over for a late breakfast - lunch or dinner. And if you want to we could walk together through Sanssouci - which is just a few minutes away from our home :D Sorry that i dont offer my couch. I gave birth to my third son 7 weeks ago and i feel like it would be to much to have overnight guests. Hope you understand!?&#x201D;</em></p>","<p>&#x201C;Wow, how nice. Sanssouci. Where&#x2019;s that?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Potsdam.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Potsdam? Where&#x2019;s that? Wasn&#x2019;t there a meeting after the war there?&#x201D;</p>","<p>We looked up Potsdam on our phones and found out it was the largest world heritage site in Germany.</p>","<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s only half an hour by train.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201D;</p>","<p>On the map, Potsdam was so close to Berlin we couldn&#x2019;t tell whether it was actually part of the city or not. Turned out it was the capital of the state of Brandenburg. Did that mean that everything west of the Brandenburg gate, including our hotel, was in the state of Brandenburg, and not actually in Berlin? It did not. The gate was just the start of the road that took you all to the way to Brandenburg. We&#x2019;d be getting the train though.</p>","<p>The caf&#xE9; we were in had no free wi-fi. Such a change from Greece, where every tiny taverna has wi-fi. It mightn&#x2019;t be very fast, and the signal may well struggle to get through the earthquake-proof walls, but it&#x2019;s there. Here, however, the <em>St&#xF6;rerhaftung</em> law says that august B&#xE4;ckerei and Caf&#xE9;s that have been serving beverages to the elite of Prussia for two-hundred years can&#x2019;t very well all of a sudden be providing the means by which pederasts or movie bootleggers do their business, so the authorities&#x2019; answer to that is to treat everyone as a would-be pederast or bootlegger. I read though that Protestant churches in Berlin and Brandenburg are now being equipped with free internet hotspots, known as &#x2018;Godspots&#x2019;. Some people think that Germans have no sense of humour, but that proves them wrong.</p>"],["<p>At breakfast one morning I asked the guy who ran the hotel what he thought about the Greek situation. He hedged for a minute, claiming it was hard for him to express his thoughts in English, but I think he was just working up the courage to give vent to what he thought in front of someone (Tina) he knew was of Greek descent.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I think they are fighting the wrong thing. They have a big problem with illegal immigrants, they need to work with Italy and the rest of Europe to fix that. The Germans are happy to help out but Greece doesn&#x2019;t make the changes they need to.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Have you been to Greece?&#x201D; I asked.</p>","<p>&#x201C;No. I&#x2019;ve been to a lot of places, but now I&#x2019;m thinking I might not want to go there. I think maybe I&#x2019;m not welcome.&#x201D;</p>","<p>A couple of months ago one of the major international European magazines had featured on its cover a mischievously manipulated picture of Angela Merkel standing amongst some Nazi bigwigs on the Acropolis under the headline &#x201C;How Europeans look at the Germans &#x2014; The German Superiority&#x201D;. There was no doubt that there was some resentment against the Germans for being seen to be the ones pushing the hardest line against Greece at that time, which I considered unfair on the Germans. The funny thing was, that magazine cover was from Der Spiegel, which is German, of course. See? More German humour.</p>","<p>When we got off the 9:47 morning train at Bahnhof Charlottenhof in Potsdam we let the other commuters clear the platform, and the young woman with a baby on her chest who was left standing when everyone else had gone had to be Gaby. She was tall and pretty, with hair light-brown to blond. There was a fair smattering of trees along the nice wide street we took on the western edge of Potsdam, with townhouses four-to-five storeys lining our path. Up we went into one of the houses, to the second floor, where Gaby lived with her husband and kids.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Sit down, please. I&#x2019;ll make you some coffee.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Alexander and Eoin were whisked off to an adjacent room - the Lego room, by the looks of things - and were not heard from again until we left. Gaby&#x2019;s husband Marc chatted to us while Gaby was in the kitchen. Where was he from? Was he a born and bred Potsdamer?</p>","<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m from Munich, but I don&#x2019;t like it there. Munich is too <em>schickimicki, </em>so I came to Potsdam.&#x201D;</p>","<p>I handed him my phone. &#x201C;You will write that word down for me, please.&#x201D;</p>","<p>He did so, and handed me back the phone.</p>","<p>&#x201C;You will continue, please.&#x201D; He did.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Munich is more expensive than Berlin; in fact, Berlin is one of the cheapest cities we could find to live.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;What do you do here?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a conflict resolution consultant.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;No!&#x201D;\nGaby come back in with the coffee. &#x201C;In Germany people in offices use negative words like &#x2018;but&#x2019;, &#x2018;problem&#x2019;, and &#x2018;sadly&#x2019;, even when they just want to say they&#x2019;ll be five minutes late for lunch,&#x201D; she said.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ja, everything is a problem for Germans,&#x201D; Marc continued. &#x201C;If they can&#x2019;t get a parking place it&#x2019;s a big problem. They have a very good life but still imagine everything is a problem. They are spoiled, like children,&#x201D; he said, pointing into the Lego room. &#x201C;They use such dramatic language in an email, and as long as they put a smiley man at the end, they think that all is okay. This is not so professional. But,&#x201D; he sighed, &#x201C;I really think smileys are the future of communication,&#x201D; he said, looking at me with a downturned mouth and a sad expression.</p>","<p>Having worked in offices myself for the last ten years I didn&#x2019;t envy his job of getting people to stop using ordinary everyday words like &#x2018;but&#x2019;, &#x2018;sadly&#x2019;, and &#x2018;problem&#x2019;. While Tina continued chatting to him and Gaby I poked around in their bookshelves. You can learn a lot that way. For instance, I straightaway found a copy of the Koran. At least I think it was the Koran. Then a &#x2018;Learn Arabic&#x2019; book.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a Muslim,&#x201D; said Marc. &#x201C;Not like the ones you see on TV, all the terrorism. That&#x2019;s just a&#x2026;mask. As well, a lot of people call themselves Muslims, but they gamble, they drink, they smoke. That&#x2019;s not Islam.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Why did you become a Muslim?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, all the coverage on TV and all the negative stuff made me interested to find out what it was really about, so I did some research. I didn&#x2019;t think it was so bad as everyone was saying and when I looked a little bit closer I decided it was something I was interested in, so I went into Berlin, talked to some people at a mosque, and they helped me.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Gaby strapped on her youngest once more and took us out for a walk towards the Sanssouci Palace in the grounds of this German version of Versailles. She left us at a picture-postcard lake, and we spent the rest of the day walking all around the Schloss Sanssouci itself, the summer Palace of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, and down the tiers of its Italianate garden, ending up at a large pond and fountain which reminded me not just of Sch&#xF6;nbrunn, a month earlier, but also of Powerscourt Gardens in Co. Wicklow. Gaby had made a difference in our experience of this city, a huge city in which, other than her and her family, and the guy who ran the Hotel-Pension who was scared to go to Greece, no-one knew who we were or what we were doing.</p>"]]},{"index":5,"title":"Pearl of the Baltic","pages":[["<p>Our next two weeks were going to see us sail into uncharted waters. I reflected on our journey&#x2019;s map so far: cathedrals, summer palaces, and concert halls dotted the middle of Europe, a sprinkling of ancient Mycaenian and Spartan ruins filled in the south-east, but the unexplored Baltic coast north of us, which was where we were headed, was empty save for the imaginary, fantastic flourishes they used to do when maps were more poetry than prose: a horde of Barbarians here, a two-headed sea monster off the coast there.</p>","<p>What we did know was that Adam and Eva, our next hosts, would take us camping for a week in their van around the lake district of Pomerania in northern Poland; they&#x2019;d organise the nightly campsites and even bring us to a remote astronomy facility in the woods near the birthplace of Copernicus for a tour by their friend. All this, as long as our two boys, Alexander and Eoin, played and spoke with their two kids, Janek and Marianna, in English. The deal on the work exchange website had not been the usual &#x2018;stay in our basement for a couple of weeks in return for household drudgery and weeding&#x2019; offer. I&#x2019;d particularly liked the sound of Copernicus. We&#x2019;d taken the deal.</p>","<p>We left from Berlin&#x2019;s Tegel airport in a minivan to get to the &#x2018;Baltic Pearl&#x2019;, as Ko&#x142;obrzeg (pronounced <em>ko-OB-jek</em>, more or less) is known. We set off in a twenty seater minivan with accompanying luggage trailer. I&#x2019;d meant to learn more about Poland over the last couple of weeks, but concerning oneself with northern Europe while sitting on the balcony in Zante was hard, so as a result I knew next to nothing about Poland. No, make that nothing. And that&#x2019;s how I wanted it. Open your eyes and see, open your ears and hear! That&#x2019;s how you should learn about a place. I put down my book, and strained with all my senses to get the measure of the land we were driving through. After about five minutes the driver flipped a screen down from the ceiling and put on <em>The Fast and the Furious 7</em>, which won an Oscar that year for being the Most Annoying Movie.</p>","<p>After roughly two hours we crossed the Oder, which in these parts forms the border with Poland, stopping in Szczecin to change driver and vehicle. We were relieved to find we could use euros to buy snacks in a newsagent, since we hadn&#x2019;t prepared as well for Poland as we should have. In fact, we didn&#x2019;t have a single z&#x142;oty to our name, but we&#x2019;d just discovered that there were four of them to a euro, which was mercifully easy to remember. We stood on the pavement outside the offices of the minivan company, eating unfamiliar confectionery. And quiet flowed the Oder straight ahead of us, running due north on its way to the Baltic.</p>","<p>After another two or so hours of pleasant, flat landscape, and more tranquility-damning movies, we were dropped at a bus stop in the middle of Ko&#x142;obrzeg. It was a fine August evening. Our instructions were to wait there for Adam.</p>","<p><em>&#x201C;First of all,&#x201D;</em> Adam had written last year, <em>&#x201C;we would like to make it clear that our offer does not really match the idea of HelpX. We treat it more like culture exchange/exploring sort of thing. What I mean is that if we arrange our tour together you will not have to do any sort of tasks for us.&#x201D;</em> At Christmas, I&#x2019;d done a Skype session with him and his wife Eva, and found to my relief that he spoke excellent English. He had a clear, loud, teacher&#x2019;s kind of voice (and matching manner, it turned out); in fact he was a teacher. Over the internet I could hear the rough, rolled burr of the Slavic &#x2018;r&#x2019;. Words ending in &#x201C;&#x2026;ing&#x201D; came out sounding &#x201C;&#x2026;ink&#x201D;. One could tell, just from a brief time Skype call, that he intended to suffer few fools in his life. Appearance-wise, he sailed just this side of being a skinhead, a style pretty common in Poland from what we could see from the people who passed us as we waited in his town. His wife Eva was a <em>profesora</em> of Spanish who gave lessons at home. I&#x2019;d mentioned that I could speak a little Spanish myself and that maybe we could <em>hablar un poco</em>.</p>","<p>&#x201C;In fact, maybe I should bone up on Polish. I&#x2019;m really interested in languages and this would give me a great opportunity to learn a slavic tongue.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Listen,&#x201D; Adam said over Skype, in the plain-speaking style we&#x2019;d be all too familiar with soon enough, &#x201C;if you want to learn a foreign language, pick German. You can use that a bit around here. Don&#x2019;t waste your time with Polish.&#x201D;</p>","<p>At one stage while we chatted he took the laptop out and brought it to the balcony of their flat to show me the sharp-angled roofs of the houses around them, all covered in snow. I had a t-shirt on for that Skype session, the only time that day I&#x2019;d worn anything on top, and late as it was in the evening, as soon as the session ended it&#x2019;d be coming off again. Summer in Queensland is a season to be endured, not enjoyed. It was strange looking out the window of a flat in a Baltic town on our laptop at snow I wanted to reach out and touch.</p>","<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;ll be here any minute. I&#x2019;m just going to see if I can find some wifi around here,&#x201D; Tina said.</p>","<p>A good fifteen minutes passed, during which some of the same people who had passed us on the pavement were passing us again, returning whence they came. The fragility of our arrangement worried me. I tried to gather my thoughts about what little I knew about this arrangement. Free accommodation, and no having to work for it. Why didn&#x2019;t I think there&#x2019;d be a catch? Why would someone do that? Just put people up, people like us - strangers. I wouldn&#x2019;t do that. Why would he do that? So what if there was snow on the roofs and it was nice to see that in the humidity of a Queensland Skype session? Right now they were sitting across the road in a bar, looking at us out the window, laughing, holding the laptop up to video us so they could show their friends the Irish eejit who thought he&#x2019;d just turn up and stay in their house for free like like it was a Communist free-for-all around here. I imagined a YouTube channel of people on streets with kids and luggage, a shaky laptop camera from a second story window, traffic and sniggers the soundtrack. &#x2018;Punk&#x2019;d in Poland&#x2019;. Tina came back: there was no wifi anywhere nearby.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Hey Dad, what will we do if he doesn&#x2019;t turn up?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I was planning on crying.&#x201D;</p>","<p><em>&gt;&#x201C;In a nutshell, we are looking for a family who want to explore Poland (or other countries) with us. We will provide you all with the camping gear and bikes with panniers and we will be travelling by my van VW T4 (nine seater), in return you will have to pay for the fuel. We will chip in for the food that we are going to cook together at the camping grounds. Camping fees will be paid separately. We would like to travel from one place to another by van and use bicycles just to get some daytrips. The time you want to spend on exploring is up to you.&#x201D;</em></p>","<p>A skinhead approached us. I pictured us standing there on the street from a skinhead&#x2019;s perspective: refugees, maybe? Why hadn&#x2019;t we arranged to meet in a hotel like normal people?</p>","<p>&#x201C;Rrralphy?&#x201D;</p>","<p>Adam hustled us into his T4 with few words, hoisting our suitcases into the back, and whisked us off down the streets. He had on a pair of camouflage shorts that I&#x2019;d rarely see him without for the following two weeks. His black t-shirt had the Camino (de Santiago) shell logo. In the centre of town, a largeish town of some fifty thousand people apparently, Adam pointed out buildings such as the Katedra - the basilica of St. Mary - and the Ratusz - the town hall - both impressive red-brick hulks in whose lee we&#x2019;d be living for the next fortnight.</p>","<p>He and his family lived on the third (top) floor of a corner apartment building within a terraced square surrounding a scruffy playground right in the heart of town. The roof sloped at something like forty-five degrees. You only had to look at the other buildings to realise that was the prevalent style around here. Some buildings were even pointier, sixty degrees not being unusual. Keeps the snow from gathering, I suppose. Being so central we&#x2019;d be able to get out from under their feet without needing public transport or a lift, I realised. It&#x2019;s always a relief when you can be master of your own destiny like that; in fact, we&#x2019;d knocked back HelpExchange offers in isolated places which made that impossible.</p>","<p>Once indoors Alexander and Eoin quickly insinuated themselves into Janek&#x2019;s and Marianna&#x2019;s bedroom. The usual social experiment was now underway. We adults sat in the front room, half chatting, half straining to hear if there were any outbreaks of hostilities. I imagined Adam and Eva were as relieved as we were that we were all getting on, and that we, the people they&#x2019;d invited into their home, weren&#x2019;t (obviously) strange, drunk, unintelligible, in possession of pestery kids, dirty, stupid, or bigoted. The feeling was mutual. There&#x2019;s only so much each party can tell in advance from reviews on a website, or even from a Skype session. Not that we had many reviews on HelpExchange. In fact we only had the one, but it was a good one. It was written by Sarah, in which she claimed, very generously, to have enjoyed every minute with us. &#x201C;In the evening we had some lovely hours chatting at the fire place,&#x201D; she&#x2019;d written. Which made me think again of their weird, pale-brown eco-logs. In Poland though, they do coal.</p>","<p>A mild wine euphoria and the relief of having successfully made a connection that had been far from guaranteed addled my thinking pleasantly. I sat there on a leather sofa while Tina told them stories about Australia and wondered to myself: who are these people? What were we doing in their house? Why were we able to just catch a coach to a thousand-year old town on the Baltic and get picked up and driven back to a skinhead&#x2019;s apartment to make ourselves at home, sit on their couch, and, if we so pleased, use their toilet, which would be soon, given the wine situation. We couldn&#x2019;t have done that in Australia or Ireland. How were we able to do that in Poland? We couldn&#x2019;t speak a word of their language. The apartment wasn&#x2019;t large, and they weren&#x2019;t rich. I could already tell, because I&#x2019;d done it once or twice in the small amount of time we&#x2019;d been there, that there&#x2019;d be a lot of apologising for blocking someone else&#x2019;s ingress or egress to or fro the kitchen, the hallway, or the main dining room. Why was this tolerated? And not just tolerated, actually, but sought out by Adam and Eva.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Rrralphy?&#x201D; Adam was gesturing to me by chopping at the side of his neck with his hand and looking at me with raised eyebrows. This meant alcohol, he explained. He was training me. &#x201C;Have some more wine, yes?&#x201D;</p>","<p>Earlier that day, we&#x2019;d squared up with the nice guy who ran the Hotel-Pension Bregenz to the tune of four hundred euros for four nights. He had a wife and two kids too. Yes, he runs a hotel in the middle of a big city. Charging me and my family to stay is how he earns his crust. He gets paid for it because it&#x2019;s hard work and it gives us something we want: a place to stay. Was a place to stay in Ko&#x142;obrzeg so worthless that it had to be given away gratis? Of course not; there are five-star hotels here too. They&#x2019;re full of Berliners, in fact. And there are places one could stay in Berlin for free, even with two kids, although in July we hadn&#x2019;t been able to find any. Even though I understood the deal that work exchange sites proposed it still confounded me sometimes.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Twenty years ago I hitchhiked in Ireland,&#x201D; Adam said.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ah cool. Sad, isn&#x2019;t it, the way no-one hitchhikes anymore. How&#x2019;d you get on?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Not so good. Two guys picked me up, then held a screwdriver to my throat and robbed me. Then they threw me out of the car.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Where?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Finglas.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ah.&#x201D; I&#x2019;ve generally avoided Finglas in my comings and goings around Dublin. And it wasn&#x2019;t a word I thought I&#x2019;d be hearing today, <em>Finglas</em>, travelling from Berlin to Ko&#x142;obrzeg. We drank to Finglas. We drank a good bit, that first night, and the crack was good. The four kids, long forgotten at that stage, shuffled in sheepishly with a request, delivered by Janek: &#x201C;Please, is it ok if Alex and Eoin may sleep with us in our room tonight?&#x201D; A glance ricocheted among us adults: were there any objections? There were no objections.</p>","<p>The kids were good, Poland was good, and Ko&#x142;obrzeg was our Baltic Pearl to explore, which was good. We said goodnight and climbed up into our attic den, where I soon banged my head on the steeply inclined, snow-busting ceiling.</p>"],["<p>That week we&#x2019;d worked our way north, from the Ionian Sea, via Berlin, the beating heart of reunited Europe, to end up on the Baltic Coast. We struck out on our first morning in Poland for the shores of the <em>Morze Ba&#x142;tyckie</em> itself, the Baltic Sea, led by young Janek who manfully conducted us along the banks of the Pars&#x119;ta river, then along an offshoot canal, fringed by weeping willows and abundant lily pads, past tower blocks a dozen stories high which seemed to grow out of the pleasant grassy embankments. Adam and Eva stayed at home, and I was guessing part of our work here, such as it was, would be to at least allow them an hour free of the kids now and again.</p>","<p>Despite the fact it was only a Tuesday morning, and despite, too, the squally showers, the seafront was packed. This was our first hint of how seriously crowded the Polish coastline gets. I suppose it&#x2019;s a question of supply and demand. Poland has a small coastline for all its large size and population. And being so close to Germany, Ko&#x142;obrzeg is popular with Germans because as well as being a pleasant seaside resort (its name means &#x2018;by the sea&#x2019;) it also has plenty of spa-type hotels and resorts. Tourists - Poles and Germans - go there for the sea air, for the mud therapy, and for the cosmetic surgery. For the Germans, it must have felt like home: Kolberg (Ko&#x142;obrzeg&#x2019;s erstwhile name), and indeed the third of Poland it finds itself in, was until recently part of Germany. The ancient German province of Pomerania, along with East Brandenburg, Lower and upper Silesia, most of east Prussia, and the port of Danzig (now called Gdansk) was granted to Poland at the end of WWII. In fact everything east of the Oder and Neisse rivers was. Everything, that is, except for the eleven million inhabitants, who were pushed back to Germany. All of these areas had been considered German for hundreds of years. In Yalta and Potsdam (so I&#x2019;d read since being there) what Poland lost in the east it gained in the west.</p>","<p>At the first sign of a gelateria, we took shelter from the sleet and the crowds. We still hadn&#x2019;t changed any euros for z&#x142;otys. What sort of half-arsed EU membership was this, I thought, where a country is all too happy to sell one of the iconic products of Europe, to wit, gelato, but too cagey to adopt the coin of the European realm. The woman who served me was most accommodating, agreeing to accept my euros, but the guy behind me who I&#x2019;d half-turned to so he could register my soppy &#x2018;sorry about that&#x2019; face that I was wearing wasn&#x2019;t having a bar of it. He&#x2019;d worked all week down a mine, or up the side of a gasometer, or skinning bears in the snow, I don&#x2019;t know, and now he just wanted a scoop of tiramisu without waiting for some eejit who&#x2019;d brought euros to a zloty situation. He stood behind me, wanting to kill me, I imagined. I came out and gave Tina her gelato. &#x201C;We need z&#x142;otys, right now.&#x201D;</p>","<p>We stood in the squall at the foot of a lighthouse, made out of red brick like just about every other building of note here, while the rain gathered its strength. I breathed in the salty spray on the seafront. Next stop north was the Danish island of Bornholm, an expensive couple of hours&#x2019; ferry-ride away, and after that the vast, overhanging, and, to judge by the TV shows and novels they churn out like evil sausages, crime-plagued proboscis of Scandinavia.</p>","<p>Adam and Eva&#x2019;s plan was to take us all camping next week, so this week we&#x2019;d be based in their flat, making daily excursions around town. There was no lawn to weed, no toilets we had to clean, windows to polish, or children&#x2019;s homework to supervise. We never really even did much in the way of food preparation. A sweet deal indeed, a plum gig, tempered only by the occasional bit of bad weather which kept all eight of us indoors in the small flat. Luckily for us Eva turned out to be a great cook. I was a fan of hers. She&#x2019;d never studied English, but had picked up enough here and there over the years that she could more or less communicate freely with us. I tried some French on her, and she hit it back with topspin. She said she spoke Italian too, and I had absolutely no reason to doubt her. On Saturday mornings she gave Spanish lessons at home. I asked if I could sit in on her next class.</p>","<p>In the first few days we quickly attuned ourselves to Adam&#x2019;s moods, which fluctuated wildly between being a tolerable smartarse and being an annoying smartarse. You just couldn&#x2019;t tell. Actually, I tell a lie. It depended on how much he needed a <em>jemka</em>. Every day after lunch, his energy levels starting running down like the battery of a phone running the facebook app, and we would trim our sails accordingly because we knew what the matter was: it was <em>jemka</em> time. When this word, which means nap, started to be muttered aloud after lunch, we&#x2019;d grab the kids and head out to the park, or nip out for a coffee or a beer in the town centre, right outside the flat - anything, for fear of inadvertently coming between the man and the siesta. He&#x2019;d cajole the kids brusquely into going outside and playing on the scrappy grass square with the indifferent playground stuff in the middle. We didn&#x2019;t mind. A bit of slavic discipline would do them the world of good. He&#x2019;d even get ratty with Eva, who herself was placidity incarnate, and then he&#x2019;d get exasperated.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Hey Rrralphy, you know why women live longer than men?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Yeah, they have less testosterone, and testosterone is bad for you.&#x201D; I read that in Scientific American. Or one of those factoid 10-things-you-didn&#x2019;t-know clickbait things you click on when your resistance is low, like straight after lunch. Or now. I was getting cranky myself. Anyway, it was all to do with cortisone, the stress hormone.</p>","<p>&#x201C;No! They live longer because they don&#x2019;t have wifes. Google it up, Rrralphy. I&#x2019;m going for <em>jemka</em>. Kids! Out!&#x201D;</p>"],["<p>Piotr turned up on time for his Spanish class. Eva showed him into the front room. To his surprise there was an Irishman in there.</p>","<p>&#x201C;This is Ralph, and he&#x2019;s staying with us,&#x201D; Eva told him in Spanish. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s going to be joining us today.&#x201D; Piotr accepted the <em>situaci&#xF3;n</em> magnanimously, probably because his Spanish was only at an elementary level and accepting magnanimously involved less talking.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Buenos dias</em>,&#x201D; I said.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Buenos dias</em>.&#x201D;</p>","<p>He was a youngish looking guy in his forties, I guessed, dressed with a bit more panache than Adam, not that that was saying much. He wore tight, fashionable jeans, a leather jacket, and his grey hair was decently styled. He seemed genuinely keen to learn Spanish and was good-humoured about his shortcomings. All the same, he had a long road ahead of him. He was a former maths teacher, and a physicist, but ran his own company now. It was fun to be there doing Spanish again and I chatted away under the watchful eye of Eva who pulled me up constantly over my mistakes, but I didn&#x2019;t mind. I was actually helping her, I imagined. She would normally have to do all the <em>hablando</em>. When he left, he seemed genuinely glad to have met me, and my Spanish had held up pretty well, I thought.</p>","<hr>","<p>One of our fears about being here struck later on in the innocuous form of a little rain. To be stuck in the flat with no work to do and less transport, we needed to be occupied, and that wasn&#x2019;t always the case. Maybe conventional work exchanges weren&#x2019;t so bad after all. Adam suggested the <em>Muzeum Or&#x119;&#x17C;a Polskiego</em>, the Museum of Polish Arms, as a bit of light entertainment. Museums are reliable standbys of a travelling family in trouble, and so, with nothing else to do at home, out we ran, out into Town Hall Square, splashing through the rain on our way to see some guns.</p>","<p>Military history was Adam&#x2019;s bailiwick. His teacher&#x2019;s instincts made him the perfect museum tour guide. So much so that after five minutes others were tailing us, eavesdropping on our party. He&#x2019;d brought a red laser light which he shone into glass cases full of small arms, medals, decorations and badges. At one stage, he showed us the agricultural tools used by somebody called &#x2018;<em>ka-SHOOS-ko</em>&#x2019; and his supporters. We had to admit that that name, like most of the others we&#x2019;d hear and read that day, meant nothing whatsoever to us, sorry, so Adam victoriously pointed out that Tadeusz Koscuiszko had lent his name to the highest mountain in Australia. Didn&#x2019;t we know our own country?</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh, <em>Kozzie-osko</em>!&#x201D; we both said, in what must have been to poor Adam like hearing nails on a blackboard. None of us had ever been to the Snowy Mountains, way down in southern New South Wales, but there would be few Australians who didn&#x2019;t recognise the name &#x2018;Koscuiszko&#x2019; (but maybe not in its original pronunciation). Adam then proceeded to get himself worked up about the dastardly, revisionist, doubtlessly politically-motivated idea that no-one had ever heard of except him that there were moves afoot to rename Mt. Koscuiszko to an aboriginal name.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I suppose that <em>could</em> happen,&#x201D; Tina mused. &#x201C;You mean in the same way that &#x2018;Ayer&#x2019;s Rock&#x2019; became &#x2018;Uluru&#x2019;. But I&#x2019;ve never heard anything about Mount Kozzieosko.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ayer&#x2019;s Rock was just named after some British engineer, probably, but Mount Koscuiszko was the result of an expedition. If they renamed it that would be a PIECE OF BULLSHIT!&#x201D; he said, raising his voice. People looked at us. Tina and I looked at each other. I looked at the people and shrugged. Was there some serious likelihood that they were going to rename the highest mountain in Australia? If there was, we&#x2019;d never heard a peep. I tried to reassure him that Aussies would, in all likelihood, continue to mispronounce the Polish patriot they knew nothing about for a long time to come, but he was already gone, shining his laser in a glass case containing a German officers&#x2019; Parabellum, with Janek at his shoulder.</p>","<hr>","<p>That afternoon Adam came up to me brandishing a cheeseknife. &#x201C;You like to speak French, Rrralphy?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Mais oui.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;A family from France is staying here tonight.&#x201D;</p>","<p><em>Qu&#x2019;est-ce-que c&#x2019;est?</em> We were the guests here. We didn&#x2019;t need no other stinkin&#x2019; guests. &#x201C;A family from France? Where?&#x201D; </p>","<p>&#x201C;Here.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Yeah, but&#x2026;whereabouts exactly?&#x201D;</p>","<p>His finger pointed to his feet. They were going to sleep at his feet? No? Somewhere in the flat then. He seemed to be goading me to object. No, that wasn&#x2019;t right - he was simply informing me, since we were his guests too. But my first reaction was to object, which was mean of me. But really, there was hardly any room.</p>","<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s hardly any room.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh come ON! It&#x2019;ll be fun. Anyway I can&#x2019;t just leave them without somewhere to stay.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Why not? How do you know them?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t. They&#x2019;re on Warm Showers.&#x201D; He&#x2019;d told us about this network, which was like a cyclists&#x2019; version of couchsurfing.</p>","<p>&#x201C;What are their reviews like?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;They don&#x2019;t have any.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, how do you know what they&#x2019;re like? They could be like you.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;The fact that they&#x2019;re taking their kids around Europe on bikes tells me what they&#x2019;re like, Rrralphy,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the only review I need.&#x201D;\n&#x201C;Where are they now?&#x201D; I asked, ashamed of myself.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Bornholm. They couldn&#x2019;t get off the island yesterday, the weather was too bad. But they&#x2019;ll be here tonight.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Around midnight the buzzer rang, and we helped the young French family stash their bikes and all their gear in the basement of the building. They had one of those kid carrier trailers for their youngest. Now that&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;d like to see Europe: from the comfort of a kid carrier trailer. I might read my Baedecker Guide to the Railways and Spas of Europe and look out occasionally, waving to the plebs, like the Queen. Once they&#x2019;d put their three kids to sleep out in the hallway we adults sat down, cramped in the living room, and Adam broke out the drinks. Manu, the Dad, was a fresh-faced, handsome bastard. Turned out he was the &#x2018;cycling officer&#x2019; or something along those lines for the town they lived in in the Loire Valley, a position which immediately aroused Adam&#x2019;s interest; Manu&#x2019;s stock had risen in this house. Adam ran off with great urgency and retrieved a French-language cycling magazine from some cupboard, and the French family&#x2019;s cycling itinerary was then discussed at great length. Rostock, Bornholm, now Ko&#x142;obrzeg. Funnily enough, I&#x2019;ve read Bornholm described as &#x201C;the Baltic Pearl&#x201D; too. So many pearls in the Baltic. The detail into which they went about cycling was a bit too much for me, but I&#x2019;d been wrong about hosting them - the more in this flat the merrier. They were taking their kids around northern Europe on bike only to get stuck on an island, and the network, personified by Adam, had come to their rescue. He couldn&#x2019;t have been more solicitous in fact, offering them everything they needed. But like the scorpion in the fable who can&#x2019;t change its nature and ends up killing the frog, he tried to kill Manu in cold blood that very night, and by Jove he came close. His weapon: a bottle of Tradycyjna 1822.</p>","<p>Glass after glass was poured, protestations (&#x201C;<em>Ah, trop gentil mais non merci!</em>&#x201D;) were ignored, and bike shop talk was pursued. By that stage, a week in, I had the measure of Adam, and was able to fend off offers of Tradycyjna, but Manu obviously felt indebted, and he foolishly encouraged, by his very passivity, Adam&#x2019;s brazen attempt on his life.</p>","<p>In the morning, the sound of seven kids charging around the flat rang through the small apartment like the clanging of a rusty bike carrying a bag of glass down a cobbled lane. Sunlight streamed in through the dining room window, and the traffic noise reminded us all that we were right in the middle of things. Manu presented himself at the breakfast table so destroyed that he couldn&#x2019;t even manage a coffee. His handsome features were as a ghoul&#x2019;s mask that morning. Food? Out of the question. Opposite him Adam buttered and chewed away, sloshing his coffee down noisily, continuing all the bike nerd stuff. He was giving a Frenchman, of all people, a lesson in sangfroid. With a shaky hand, Manu placed a large tablet into a glass, watched it fizz, and wretchedly skulled it. His poor wife had to do everything, the prospect of a hard day in the saddle and the wheedling of <em>les enfants</em> irritating her. She got jam on her sleeve buttering so many pieces of toast and snapped at the kids. Manu had had enough. He pushed back his chair and walked off to the small room for a short while.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Manu&#x2019;s a bit fucked this morning,&#x201D; I observed.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, he shouldn&#x2019;t have drunk so much last night, Rrralphy,&#x201D; Adam replied, flicking through the French bike mag.</p>"],["<p>I had a date on Saturday. Our ambition to spend more time with local people on our travels had reached its natural climax with me being asked out on a date. By Piotr.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a Spanish teacher,&#x201D; I said to Eva. &#x201C;Why does he want me to go out with him?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Relax Rrralphy, don&#x2019;t be so worried,&#x201D; said Adam, poring over maps in preparation for our camping trip. &#x201C;He probably just wants a little oral practice, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;What are we going to talk about? Where&#x2019;s he going to take me?&#x201D; I asked Eva, wringing my hands and trying not to sound so much like Woody Allen.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, he said he&#x2019;d pick you up at four and you can go for a drive and talk to each other in Spanish,&#x201D; she said.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Talk to each other? About what?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Just talk about whatever you see&#x201D;.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Huh? What are we going to see?&#x201D;</p>","<p>Piotr arrived wearing leather pants. Why was he wearing leather pants? But it was too late for whys. In his upmarket car he drove me, in near-silence, tinged with bad Spanish, to the town&#x2019;s Marina, which, being a Spanish word, eased us into things. We walked along the quay, struggling to make talk about our surroundings. I had to dig deep to get the Spanish words out for the things we saw - boats and nets, fluffy clouds, ugly buildings, the river Pars&#x119;ta itself - words I knew must be in there, but which hurt my head to retrieve at conversation speed. He pointed at a seagull: &#x201C;&#xBF;Que es?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Pajaro,&#x201D; I answered. The generic term for &#x2018;bird&#x2019; would have to do him. It was ridiculous that I felt guilty not knowing the word for a seagull, and so I blathered on a bit, extending <em>pajaro</em> to <em>pajaro de la mar</em>, which I hoped he&#x2019;d never use since a Spanish speaker would probably think he was talking about a penguin or a flying fish. I felt like saying &#x201C;How the <em>diablo</em> would I know the word for &#x2018;seagull&#x2019; in Spanish? It just never came up in Spanish classes in Brisbane, which is not on the sea,&#x201D; but realised I would have to say that in Spanish, since he didn&#x2019;t speak English and I didn&#x2019;t speak Polish, and since it contained the word &#x2018;seagull&#x2019; would only leave me back where I started, broken and defeated. He drove past his factory, telling me what they made there (&#x201C;cosas&#x201D; - &#x201C;things&#x201D;) and that he employed &#x201C;<em>mucho persona</em>&#x201D;. I was getting a grand tour of Ko&#x142;obrzeg; I just had to keep up a running <em>comentario</em> to earn it.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Vamos ahora a mi casa.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>&#xBF;Tu casa? Ok, &#xBF;porque no?</em>&#x201D;\nPiotr lived in a large, one-storey house in a quiet, residential area. I wondered what it would have been like to have stayed here instead of at Adam&#x2019;s, waking up every morning having to talk Spanish and unable to get into town under our own steam. We&#x2019;d probably have had a bit more room too, and no pointy roof to bang my head against. There were plenty of books and decent art on the walls. &#x201C;<em>Aqui es la&#x2026;?</em>&#x201D; We were in a modern-looking kitchen. &#x201C;<em>Cocina.</em>&#x201D; We would pause in every room to give me time to say something appropriate. Not being particularly interested in other peoples&#x2019; houses, I struggled, as I would have in English too.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Este es mi&#x2026;</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>&#xBF;Cuarto de dormir? &#xBF;Dormitorio?</em>&#x201D; I offered. </p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Si.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>Finding myself in the bedroom of a man with leather pants on, I wondered where his wife was. &#x201C;By the way, ahem&#x2026;<em>&#xBF;donde esta tu esposa?</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>No se,</em>&#x201D; he shrugged. Probably out swinging somewhere, I ungraciously thought. &#x201C;<em>&#xA1;Ay, que bonito jardin!</em>&#x201D; I said, pointing out the window.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Ah, si, es muy bonito, gracias.</em>&#x201D; He looked at me and smiled. I smiled back. He stepped aside with a creak of expensive leather and let me out of his bedroom.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Vamos a&#x2026;una cerveza.</em>&#x201D; He wanted&#x2026;to do something with a beer. </p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>&#xBF;Beber? &#xBF;Beber una cerveza?</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Si. Vamos a beber una cerveza.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Que buena idea.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>We drove from his place towards the sea, past a massive sanatorium-type of hotel complex, a reminder to me of this town&#x2019;s important role as a health resort for Germans, and even Danes, who come, like Manu and his family had, from Bornholm island. The road ended on the seafront a couple of kilometres east of town at an old brick fort topped by a glass cupola. This used to be an outlying part of the fortress of Ko&#x142;obrzeg, built right where there&#x2019;d been heavy fighting two hundred years ago between the people of Kolberg and the army of the Duchy of Warsaw. It had even been pressed back into service during WWII, but nowadays functioned as a caf&#xE9;/bar/disco. The day was fading and it was actually breezy and cold now. &#x201C;<em>&#xBF;Cerveza?</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Si, gracias.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>He went off for the drinks, leaving me to reflect on my afternoon&#x2019;s work; he spoke not a word of the Queen&#x2019;s English, and I no Polish, so we&#x2019;d had no safety net when Spanish failed us, which made talking both frustrating and exhilarating. If we&#x2019;d been talking to each other at all, which we had been, then we must have been talking Spanish. You could just about see the town back along the dunes which had breakwaters jutting out into the sea every hundred or so metres. Looking out over the water I thought about the way people go on cruises in big fancy boats. It&#x2019;d be nice to go on a cruise. See the Baltic, from Norway to the Gulf of Bothnia, stopping off at Bornholm, now I knew about it. Live like kings on a floating hotel. Piotr returned and placed a Heineken in front of me.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Gracias.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>No, gracias&#x2026;a tu</em>,&#x201D; he said, nodding at me.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>De nada.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>He gamely raised his mineral water, and we clinked glasses. The sea was calm, and there were still people walking along the dunes by the shore.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Muy tranquillo, &#xBF;no?</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Si, muy tranquillo.</em>&#x201D;</p>"]]},{"index":6,"title":"Off the leash in Pomerania","pages":[["<p><em>&#x201C;Most travel, and certainly the rewarding kind, involves depending on the kindness of strangers, putting yourself into the hands of people you don&#x2019;t know and trusting them with your life.&#x201D;</em> Ghost Train to the Eastern Star by Paul Theroux.\n<em>&#x201C;I suggest we do not travel long distances and visit a couple of places close to my area and stay in the woods, go swimming in the lakes, go hiking and just enjoy the time together by the camp fire.

On top of the piles of camping and cooking paraphernalia Adam seemed to store there on a semi-permanent basis there were now several suitcases, an accordion (in a hard case), a guitar, three tents, and two inflatable sharks, currently uninflated. Despite the seeming formality of the suitcases, Adam insisted they were the best way of grouping each family&#x2019;s things in the van so they could be hauled out at the end of each day and into a family tent. Heading away from the setting sun, our destination was a campsite two hours away due east, minimally provisioned by all accounts.</p>","<p>&#x201C;This is the real Polish camping, Rrralphy,&#x201D; Adam said, catching my eye in the mirror on the outskirts of town.</p>","<p>&#x201C;How do you mean?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;No toilets, no showers. But we stop to get <em>pivo</em>, yes?&#x201D; he said, angling his head slightly, chopping his neck with his hand. Real Polish camping sounded, not to mix my regions, like it might be a bit Spartan. We&#x2019;d already been to Sparta that summer and would just as soon have left it at that. In our rush to avail of Adam and Eva&#x2019;s offer on the work exchange site Tina and I may have - how to put this? - overstated our enthusiasm for camping. Still, when in Rome.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Great!&#x201D; I said. In his rear view mirror Adam could see into my soul through his shades.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Come on you Irish pussy, don&#x2019;t embarrass your wife.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;No, no. It sounds great. Hey Alexander, Eoin, you looking forward to some real Polish camping?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Not really, Dad.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Out our window pale green flat fields gave way to yellow flat fields and then back again to pastel green ones in a quilt of loveliness that probably involved wheat. I&#x2019;m no expert. The horizon became alive with the movement of wind turbines, evidence of Poland&#x2019;s attempts as a good EU citizen to wean itself off its filthy coal habit.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Stork! In the field - look!&#x201D; said Janek as we passed a lone black and white individual standing motionless as we passed. At the next village, we strained to look up out of the frame of the VW to see some of the huge box nests that people build and stick up on top of telegraph poles.</p>","<p>After an hour&#x2019;s drive we pulled in at a retail park on the outskirts of Koszalin, the capital of Pomerania. After some fast food, a last concession to civilisation before the coming wilderness, we stocked up on camping gear: sleeping sheets, fleeces, and brand new sleeping bags for the kids which Janek and Marianna would keep when we were finished the trip. If it sounds unthrifty of us to treat camping equipment lightly like that, well, they were cheap and we&#x2019;d only need them for this trip.</p>","<p>By the time we reached the village of Polon&#xF3;w it was nearly dark. The campsite we were aiming for showed up clearly on his phone map - Adam had it all under control. We wasted precious daylight, however, just finding the campsite road, and then more, with a bit of back and forth down a narrow lane, since nothing was jumping out as being an obvious campsite.</p>","<p>&#x201C;That can&#x2019;t be it.&#x201D; Adam said. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s try down that last path again.&#x201D;</p>","<p>We were all silent in the back. There was a sort of tension - there would be every night - as we circled around a candidate site waiting for Adam to positively identify it. For all its starkness and clarity on the phone screen, though, the campsite remained invisible to us. I hadn&#x2019;t camped for about ten years, not since Tina and I did a couple of weekend stays in campsites around Brisbane. Warm places. Well-marked out, easy to find. With bottle shops close by. And it had always seemed to us like a good idea to arrive in daylight, the better to put up tents and not lose an eye on a protruding branch.</p>","<p>&#x201C;This has to be the right road, there&#x2019;s nowhere else.&#x201D;</p>","<p>No sign of a campsite. A graveyard, yes. No! We&#x2019;re not camping there. It crossed his mind, though - I know it did. In the end we turned into a heavily rutted mud field which opened onto a small, wooded patch of land liberally sprinkled with pine cones, and decided out of fatigue and exasperation that this place must be it, despite the lack of sign, toilets, fellow campers, or any evidence whatsoever that anyone else was camping, or had ever camped, there. The on-board artificial intelligence of Adam&#x2019;s phone was non-committal, neither confirming nor denying that this was our campsite. Understandably, it seemed to have gone to bed. We dragged our suitcase from the back of the van out onto the cones and got straight to work bumping into each other in the dark.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Rrralphy, you come with me. We go and get water.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Back in Polon&#xF3;w he pulled in at the only pub we&#x2019;d seen and leaving me in the van he confidently strolled past the bouncer into the pub. I wondered what the bouncer was for if not to stop people like Adam entering the place. I&#x2019;d have stopped him. From inside the van I stared into the darkness and wondered what it would be like to just run across those fields in the darkness. If it even was a field, that is; it was too dark to tell. There might be mines, old Russian ones, or German ones: they had a war here, after all. No, I&#x2019;d probably run straight into a wind turbine, silent in the dead of night. A knock on the window took me out of my reverie. Adam was as happy as a Pole with a case of beer, smiling and furiously chopping at his neck. In a layby nearby we filled up our camp water bladders with freezing water at a lion&#x2019;s head font in an old wall. Adam lit a smoke and offered me one. A mile from our wives and kids with beers in our hands we smoked furtively and in haste as if a headmaster was about to come across us at any second.</p>","<p>The three tents were up (the kids would all share one) back at base camp. Other than having to pick out the cones from beneath our sleeping bags, and the total lack of amenities, it was a perfect spot. Was this the actual campsite we&#x2019;d been aiming for? Only daylight would tell. Stumbling around for firewood we found an axe by a half-burned log. Adam was delighted and started using it immediately to prepare the fire. It worried me that this was a place where people just left axes lying around. All sorts of scenarios, most involving the axe, came unbidden to my mind. What if the rightful owner of the axe returned, already annoyed at having forgotten it, saw us using it and, naturally enough, took exception. It could be tricky, the business of handing over an axe to its vexed owner. You&#x2019;d want to retreat to a safe distance while he took it. It could have been his favourite axe. He might have a sentimental attachment to it &#x2013; it might have been a wedding present. Had we stumbled into the sort of place where axes were given as wedding presents?</p>","<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think we should use this axe, Adam.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Get the beers,&#x201D; he said, using the axe liberally. We were all accomplices now.</p>","<p>Adam got his accordion out once he&#x2019;d lit the fire and with a hot sausage in my hand I sat back with everyone else and enjoyed watching him playing Polish folk music. At least that&#x2019;s what I presumed it was (the Polish music bit, not the bit about the sausage). What a day! It was still warm. I looked up and saw the Milky Way shining down on us like floodlights. Before turning in, I fixed the positions of The Plough and Cassiopeia in the sky. Later, watering my horses in the middle of the night I had a rough idea of how much time had passed by observing how far around the circle the celestial hands of the clock had rotated. The dying embers of our fire radiated light and heat back into space.</p>","<p>In the sunshine of the morning we realised we were on a small headland jutting out into a lake. Men still as statues fished on the far side several hundred yards away. Highlit dragonflies zipped over the surface. That mud field we&#x2019;d lurched through last night looked like some sort of motocross circuit with a crude concrete stand for spectators.</p>","<p>Breakfast was ham and cheese rolls. With coffee in oval-shaped thick military-green plastic cups that we&#x2019;d get to know pretty well this week, the day&#x2019;s itinerary was discussed. We were given a rich menu of options for the day, indeed for the week, sights they were happy to drive us to. Adam and Eva seemed determined to entertain and edify us on this trip, to present Poland in as good a light as they could. That worked for us.</p>","<p>By mid-morning we&#x2019;d been to a family-run amber museum and workshop (jewellery&#x2019;s completely lost on me - I was the swine before which pearls were cast that day), followed by a large-scale engineering project, to wit: a hydro-electric station. We walked through a wood along the banks of a canal that fed the station, stopping at its head to look down the length of its huge pipes that sloped a hundred or so metres to a lower lake. Having duly expressed approval and awe, we moved on. Mirachowo Miniature park had models of Gdansk cathedral, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Yucatecan Maya ruins, and the lighthouses of the Baltic (including, I was pleased to see, that of Ko&#x142;obrzeg). Nearby, there was a decommissioned airliner which you could climb up into, in which the seats were arranged to face each other, four at a time, with a table in the middle, sort of like being on a train. &#x201C;Used to be restaurant,&#x201D; Eva told us.</p>","<p>With the temperature rising, we bivouacked beside a lake for a few hours. Adam snuck in a <em>jemka</em> in the back of the T4 while Alexander and Eoin read on the grass and Tina and I floated on our backs in the water and looked up at little puffs of clouds. In the cloudy water, floating on our backs, we drifted, much as we were drifting we knew not where with this family.</p>","<p>The inexorable gravity of the coastline on the traveller through Pomerania meant, however, that the Thoreauvian bliss we&#x2019;d felt in the expanse of lakes and forest of last night was set to disappear that evening. By the time we hit pretty &#x141;eba in the late afternoon the crowds had thickened. It was the beginning of August, the weather was spectacular, and we were at the coast of a country of some forty million people, all on holiday. On spec we drove through a campsite near the beach. Out of our windows we regarded the crush of sunburnt, stereo-playing inhabitants with suspicion. I didn&#x2019;t think I was the only one amongst us hoping there was no space left. As the T4 moved through the site at a snail&#x2019;s pace, Adam cast his hardened gaze out over the sea of camper vans and bodies, combing the grounds for a place, while Tina and I made subtle remarks to the effect maybe we should try elsewhere, but we knew it was their call. Maybe we were being too fussy: we needed to relax and just accept that this is the summer and that&#x2019;s what you get.</p>","<p>&#x201C;This place is full of drrrunken fools,&#x201D; was Adam&#x2019;s expert opinion. &#x201C;I think we try away from the sea, yes?&#x201D;</p>","<p>On the edge of a yet another lake a few miles away in a much quieter site we pitched our tents over a scattering of molehills. I took a beer from the back of the van and sat down, relieved that sense had prevailed. Sure, we weren&#x2019;t right beside the beach, but it was quiet here. I took a swig of Heineken.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Rrralphy &#x2013; come with me. We need to have a chat.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re in trouble now,&#x201D; Tina laughed. I walked off after Adam, wondering what I&#x2019;d said or done. He ducked under a washing line near the toilet block and pulled out two cigarettes. I&#x2019;d more or less given up smoking years ago, but was able, on occasions such as this, to take it up again without lapsing into old ways. The kids had been scandalised on the rare occasions they saw me at it, so, what with Adam&#x2019;s kids feeling the same, we were always forced to act much like I remember acting when I was fourteen: having to retreat into the shadows to prosecute my grubby vice. With tins in our hands we puffed away, giving the Mums bringing their kids for their evening showers the nod.</p>","<p>With the tents up, Tina and I watched the windsurfers on the lake slowly become silhouettes in the dusk as the sun began to pitch its own tent. The accordion came out again that night, surprising me anew with how piercing the sound was. Adam had barely started playing when a few of the neighbouring campers came around and shyly danced with their kids. I chatted to a young guy from Dresden who was an illustrator of kids&#x2019; books by trade. He handed me a cigarette. All this camping was going to kill me.</p>"],["<p>For all that they seemed indefatigable in their efforts to show us the highlights of Pomerania, we were relieved to find that Adam and Eva weren&#x2019;t above letting an afternoon drift by occasionally, just lying on a rug in the campsite with a beer while the kids all played together.</p>","<p>&#x201C;We decided after our last helpers that we would only get helpers in the future we were actually going to spend time with,&#x201D; Adam said, yawning in our face. As we talked on, he went uncharacteristically quiet, slipping down on his side behind Eva. <em>Jemka</em> time. But that day was the exception. Most days we packed so much in that there was little time at twilight to take everything out of the van and set up the tents and cook. On occasion the day&#x2019;s fatigue would rise to the surface like a dead fish. One afternoon, dog tired and unable to decide whether to splash out on a pedalo and do a tour of yet another lake, Tina and I started arguing. Hearing us go at it, Adam sought to diffuse the tension with the <em>mot juste</em>:</p>","<p>&#x201C;Hey Rrralphy.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Hang on - what is it Adam?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I have a question.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;What is it? What&#x2019;s so funny?</p>","<p>&#x201C;Where do Polish women keep their money when they go swimming?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>","<p>It was tough on the kids too. By mid-week Janek was openly rebelling against Adam. It came to a head one dusk as we were setting up camp on the narrow beach of a large lake. A heavenly spot, but Janek had no eyes for its beauty. According to him, Marianna wasn&#x2019;t pulling her weight, and he didn&#x2019;t see why he had to put up the kids&#x2019; tent without her being involved in any way. Father and son went at it for a while until Adam pulled the rug out from beneath Janek&#x2019;s feet. &#x201C;English, Janek. We have guests.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Gathering himself against his growing consternation, Janek tearfully continued: &#x201C;But father, why Marianna does not have to help to put up the tents too?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;She&#x2019;s the youngest, Janek.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;But Eoin is younger than Marianna and he helps.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Which was true. I kept my head down and continued slicing onions. Janek was on his own. It must be tough growing up in a foreign language, but the success of this trip depended on peace between the two houses. This would be an excellent time to have a swim, I thought, and slithered into the water once I&#x2019;d finished the onions. For a hundred yards or so the border reeds that would otherwise prevent one from getting to the water for most of the circumference of this lake had been cleared, allowing campers to enjoy a small stretch of sand that dates from when this part of Pomerania used to be on the Baltic coast, rather than thirty miles south of it. Up to my neck in the water I could just about make out the town on the other side we&#x2019;d passed through to get there about two hours earlier. The sun had just gone down over the trees and the sky was still blue. There was something about being in a lake that encouraged introspection, I was finding, because every evening around this time I kept going over the trip in my mind. I was in Poland on a camping trip with a family we barely knew. Being in Poland was nothing like I imagined, since I hadn&#x2019;t really imagined it would be like anything. It had been warm so far, very warm - the roads were great (for some reason, one of the few things I &#x2018;knew&#x2019; about Poland was that the roads were bad), and there hadn&#x2019;t really been that many communists to speak of. I hadn&#x2019;t seen a single five-year plan yet. In fact, I didn&#x2019;t even know what we were doing tomorrow. I easily tripled the amount of times I&#x2019;d swum in lakes in my life in the half a dozen or so cases I&#x2019;d done so by that stage. There, in that lake, it dawned on me that that was a supremely enviable position to be in. It may well be the very definition of happiness: to find oneself in a lake and not know what one is going to do the following day.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Hey Rrralphy, we go to Hel tomorrow,&#x201D; Adam yelled at me. Yes, it must have been happiness I&#x2019;d felt, because it hadn&#x2019;t lasted long. You find yourself happy for a minute or two, and then someone wants to drag you to Hel with them.</p>","<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve been through this,&#x201D; I shouted, rotating to a standing position. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not going to go to Hel.&#x201D;</p>","<p>We&#x2019;d had half a plan to go to a place called Hel which lies at the end of the weedy peninsula protruding into the gulf of Danzig, then get the ferry to Gdansk while Adam did valet duty and took the car into town for a downtown rendez-vous. After seeing the crowds in &#x141;eba, and considering the narrow road, we began to rethink.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not go to Hel. It sounds awful,&#x201D; I&#x2019;d said to Tina. Everyone in Poland goes to the coast in weather like this. We&#x2019;ve got the best beaches in the world at home. I love the woods and the lakes.&#x201D; She tended to agree. But we weren&#x2019;t in charge.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ok, Rrralphy, we don&#x2019;t go to Hel. Take it easy. We go to Chmielno instead,&#x201D; he shouted back. &#x201C;But at least you can blow a shark,&#x201D; he shouted, holding up the shark-shaped inflatable beach toys. I had resolved not to waste time with plastic beach crap that nobody needed and had told him so. Two minutes later, he reappeared, blowing up a shark. Job done, he threw it to the kids, giving me both middle fingers as he walked back. Alexander and Eoin and Janek and Marianna were all playing quietly in the sand on the beach; we had a fire going by that stage. I asked Alexander what they were playing.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Civilization.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;The computer game?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p>","<p>So, there we were in Bumfuck, Pomerania, and Alexander and Eoin had still managed to play a computer game. You had to hand it to them, squatting there on the sandy shore of a pristine lake, as they reinforced their city defenses with wet sand and pebbles and positioned their troops and catapults near the waters edge.</p>","<p>After camp &#x2018;dinner&#x2019; Adam and I found ourselves both standing at the piss tree at the same time. He farted loudly, shattering the sylvan tranquility. &#x201C;&#x2018;Wherever you be, let your wind go free&#x2019;,&#x201D; he said, quoting, if I wasn&#x2019;t mistaken, Molly Bloom in <em>Ulysses</em>. Not wanting to be outdone I quickly riposted with a strained and angry quack, full of despair. &#x201C;&#x2018;It&#x2019;s a good horse that farts as it pisses&#x2019;, as they say in the Isle of Man,&#x201D; I said. We both stood there with our heads down as the silence gathered around us once again.</p>","<p>&#x201C;So - I know an Irish writer. You know any Polish writers?&#x201D; he asked. I couldn&#x2019;t believe it: he could even turn farting into a pissing contest.</p>","<p>&#x201C;No, but remember we spoke about Krystov Kieslowsjki and how I&#x2019;d seen <em>Three Colours: Red</em>, <em>White</em>, and <em>Blue</em>, and <em>A Short Film about Killing</em> when they came out years ago. Remember? So: you know any Irish filmmakers?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Stephen Frrry?&#x201D;</p>"],["<p>One of the lessons I was learning on this trip was that you&#x2019;re off to a flying start to the day if you have your breakfast by a lake, especially if it&#x2019;s a lake untroubled by mosquitoes or flies. It was my job every morning to wash out all the cutlery, cups and dishes, knives and forks, in the lake water after breakfast. As I took the dripping camp bag back to where Adam was packing up to leave, I found him standing in front of me with a tin of peaches in his hand.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Hey Rrralphy, do you know how many days you can wear a pair of underpants?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Tell me, Adam.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Five&#x201D;, he said, putting the tin down on the grass. He hoisted the elasticated band of his boxers over the top of his camouflage shorts, which themselves had easily seen five consecutive sunrises. &#x201C;First day: normal.&#x201D; With a flourish of his hands, he mimed rotating his undies around his waist. &#x201C;Second day, you turn them round.&#x201D; Then, like Good King Dagobert, who put his trousers on inside out, according to the French nursery rhyme:</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>Le Bon Roi Dagobert\nA mis sa culotte &#xE0; l&#x2019;envers</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>he moved his hands up and away from his torso with a graceful flourish: &#x201C;Third day; the opposite, inside&#x2026;?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Inside out.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Inside out.&#x201D; He did the rotation again, eyes fixed on me to make sure I was following. &#x201C;Fourth day, turn them around again.&#x201D; He paused then, regarding me with unwashed malice. &#x201C;So, you know how you wear them on the fifth day?&#x201D; With every combination of inside-out and back-to-front exhausted at that stage, I admitted with a sinking feeling that I didn&#x2019;t. He did a combination of rotation, and up-and-away. &#x201C;Random!&#x201D;</p>","<hr>","<p>That afternoon we crossed the Vistula, the river that sounds like a disease you might catch from drinking its water. We were now in eastern Poland. I thought of the lumbering war machines that had crossed that river - Napoleon&#x2019;s Grande Arm&#xE9;e, the Wehrmacht, the Red Army, Pink Floyd&#x2019;s &#x2018;The Wall&#x2019; tour - and once again, I began to fret about the coming darkness. All this not knowing where I was going didn&#x2019;t bother me too much - it was our driver not knowing where he was going that was getting to me. But we found that day&#x2019;s campsite - a minimalist extravaganza consisting of a field and a small lake with woods on the far side - before it got dark, <em>mirabile dictu</em>. It was still full of day picnickers, but they were beginning to drift away, gradually leaving only the hardened alcoholic backwoodsmen who were actually going to camp here.</p>","<p>Alexander, Eoin, and I were immediately dispatched for firewood like the men none of us were. Three less able gatherers it would be harder to find. The boys wouldn&#x2019;t recognise firewood unless it was in Minecraft or had a big red arrow floating above it saying &#x2018;click here for firewood&#x2019;. My own skills at foraging in the woods had been honed by years of website development (both permanent and contract) in Queensland Government offices. Back at the fire that Adam was building up I threw about three and a half joules&#x2019; worth in a heap, which made no noise on impact with the ground. &#x201C;There. I&#x2019;m going to read about things now.&#x201D;</p>","<p>To the sound of people splashing in the lake, our large fire soon lit the growing darkness. Sausages were handed around, and we sat around the fire to cook them on bits of spare firewood. &#x201C;Hey Rrralphy, put the coils on the ends of the sticks.&#x201D; Adam had handed out a couple of metal devices, things the English language is poorly equipped to describe adequately, that slipped over the pointy end of one&#x2019;s stick and splayed out into a forked spiral, perfect for affixing one&#x2019;s sausage to. I marvelled anew at his Pandora&#x2019;s box of camping doodads.</p>","<p>There was a tentful of guys playing music and being a bit noisy down near the lake, and when Adam inevitably started up the accordion after we&#x2019;d finished eating, a couple of them ambled over with a bottle. They squatted at Adam&#x2019;s feet and thought him a god. Each new tune caused a new round of recognition and approval, while Adam barely reacted, nodding maybe, smiling at their appreciation, but not wanting to encourage them too much. They had absolutely no English, and he was able to tell me in between songs that they were what were called &#x2018;boom service&#x2019; guys: Poles working in Norway demolishing buildings at night, come back for the weekend to let off steam. They settled at our bench for a chat. I can&#x2019;t remember everything that was said, but I remember the gist of it:</p>","<p>Boom service guy: &#x201C;Vodka! Vodka! Ha ha ha! You, vodka!&#x201D;</p>","<p>Me: &#x201C;Ah, no thanks!&#x201D;</p>","<p>Boom service guy: &#x201C;Vodka! You, vodka!&#x201D;</p>","<p>Me: &#x201C;No, really, I shouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Over and over the two of them kept pressing vodka on me. I kept resisting. They kept persisting. Adam kept playing, and the fire kept crackling away. The kids spent most of their time searching for but never quite finding a point of thermal equilibrium, a distance from the fire whereat they might cook their sausages without cooking themselves. Occasionally the boom service guys would turn to Adam to sing a line or two of whatever patriotic polka he was playing, before turning back to me to suggest joining them in a drink. Specifically, a vodka. I worried that they would get aggressive about it, such was their enthusiasm, but they knew what they were doing. Being aggressive would just have distracted them from holding up the vodka bottle and pressing me to have some. For my part, I&#x2019;d sensibly budgeted a couple of tins of alcohol for the evening, and by that stage I&#x2019;d already blown the budget. Vodka would just set the cat among my budget&#x2019;s pigeons, but I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d be able to explain budget pigeons to a boom service guy in a field. So I went over to the fire to get away. I held a sausage out to the fire, enjoying the heat. One of the boom guys came over and sat beside me. Despite the lack of a common lingua franca he sought to forge a mutual communication in the way tribesmen from different sides of the valley must have done in the woods of Europe since at least the days of Charlemagne. The flickering light danced on his face as he pushed out the strange sounds that would bridge the cultural gulf between us: would I like some vodka? We both stared into the fire. Sparks like night angels flew out and singed our sausages. I awaited his next gambit, although I had a fair idea which direction he might take the conversation and had already prepared my riposte.</p>","<p>In the end, though, I had that vodka. It had been a mistake to think I could just walk into the Polish woods and assume I&#x2019;d be in charge of my own alcohol consumption; I knew that now. Like Manu last week, I wasn&#x2019;t coming out of this one unhungover. With the poison coursing through my veins I lay sleepless in the hot tent that night and contemplated the miserable morning ahead of me. My plight was the stuff of an early Polanski movie: a man from the city, an educated man with unlined hands, goes camping to get back to nature, meets some boom service guys home for the weekend, is offered a vodka and foolishly refuses, claiming to have drunk his quota for the evening. But the matter doesn&#x2019;t end there, and in the shocking denouement the educated man from the city with the hands finds out that his bourgeois assumptions about his place in the world are upended&#x2026;</p>","<p>They were at it all night, till daybreak. Splashing around in the lake and laughing like mad. I&#x2019;d never heard anyone, child or man, enjoy themselves as much as those guys did that night, and I&#x2019;ve taken my kids to Dreamworld to see The Wiggles. I can still hear them. It was a happy joyful noise, I had to admit, as I lay in the tent failing to achieve any sleep whatsoever, cursing my inability to process alcohol the way others could but still drinking it as if I could. The sun rose to their splashing and laughter and lit the inside of Tina&#x2019;s and my flimsy tent, in which I tossed and turned, realising I would shortly have to rise from the dead to pay penance in the blue portacrapper in the corner of the field.</p>","<hr>","<p>Frombork is a small town on the coast, the last bit of Polish coast before the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, some ten kilometres away. It&#x2019;s a funny old coast though. There&#x2019;s a protective membrane of headland a few kilometres off the coast forming a lagoon and sheltering the town. Not that I was in any position to enjoy the beach or the rest of Frombork&#x2019;s charms. I was a straggler that morning, just about hanging on. As soon as I came across a caf&#xE9;, I sat down and let the others go on. Tina and the kids walked ahead and Adam and Eva were somewhere, and I didn&#x2019;t care. I ordered a coffee and groggily read a book I&#x2019;d downloaded on my tablet about an Irish guy who had taken up a teaching position somewhere in the countryside in Poland in the &#x2018;90s and had all these stories to tell about how poor and traditional Poland was back then. And this is from someone from Ireland. When I felt up to walking again I went looking for the others and pottered about for an hour in the sun with no idea where anyone else was. I felt like Graham Greene in Palenque, weak and sticking out. At least I didn&#x2019;t need a <em>burro</em>.</p>","<p>Frombork may have been small, but it did have a Foucault&#x2019;s Pendulum. This was in the form, in case you don&#x2019;t know what one of those is, of a heavy lead ball hanging fifty or sixty feet from the inside of the dome of the Nicolaus Copernicus Museum, a one-time cathedral, which swings slowly from side to side, as pendulums are wont to do, having been given its starting push that morning. The thing that defines it as a Foucault&#x2019;s, and therefore that means it can be used to prove the earth is rotating, is that an object placed near the edge of the pendulum&#x2019;s swing will eventually be knocked over as the pendulum&#x2019;s axis of movement slowly moves around the clockface, so to speak. When this happens someone from the museum places the object out of the pendulum&#x2019;s reach again, only to have it knocked down once more in half an hour or so. The further towards the equator you go, the quicker a pendulum deviates from a straight, zero-degree back-and-forth movement. At the poles, on the other hand, you could place anything right beside the pendulum and nothing would happen, ever. In fact, people would wonder why you had gone to all the trouble of making a huge pendulum that just swung back and forth in a straight line like pendulums tend to do.</p>","<p>Out on the balcony of the Museum high over the town we could see into Kaliningrad. My head was clear now and I stared Russia down. &#x201C;This is a ticking time-bomb,&#x201D; said Adam, squinting into the haze. &#x201C;Putin could say, well, we need a corridor to the rest of Russia. Then they will move in, just like in Krim.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Where?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Krim.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Where?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Krim.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Crimea?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Where?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Crimea.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Where?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Crimea.&#x201D;</p>","<p>On the TV in our Berlin hotel room, in between Tour de France clips, we&#x2019;d watched President Putin attend the traditional military celebrations in Kaliningrad. I hadn&#x2019;t actually been aware of where Kaliningrad was then: it was just a vaguely Russian-sounding name somewhere east. Now there it was, a few fields away. Frombork in fact was the furthest east we&#x2019;d make it on this trip. It hadn&#x2019;t seemed like much when Adam told us about it, but as someone fascinated with the history of science, I was happy to be in the town Copernicus was from, and, moreover, to have finally seen a Foucault&#x2019;s Pendulum. Even more impressive sights were to come.</p>","<p>We&#x2019;d heard, of course, of the Knights Templar, the medieval mercenary army established in the south of France to protect pilgrims to the holy land during the Crusades. Indeed we looked forward to getting down to Templar country at some stage before we returned to Australia. But I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;d ever heard of the Teutonic Knights, a German chivalric order of power-hungry monk knights, who, once they&#x2019;d finished doing God&#x2019;s work in Palestine and the Holy Land, relocated to the Baltic to wage war on the pagan tribes of Prussia. Starting around the year 1370, the Teutonic Order built Malbork Castle, right on an ancient east-west trading route on the Nogat, and in short order it became the biggest brick castle in the world. We camped the next night in a field across the river Nogat from the castle, next to a middle-aged German rocker type who presented himself to the world, disappointingly, in black leather underpants and spent all his time tinkering with an old, army-green Hercules motorcycle.</p>","<p>As we approached it the next morning, it seemed in surprisingly good shape for something that old, allowing for occasional touch-ups and restoratons over the centuries. &#x201C;Ah Rrralphy, look at the pictures.&#x201D;</p>","<p>I looked in the direction Adam was nodding and saw massive placards showing black and white photographs of a vaguely castle-shaped pile of rubble, which is what the compound had been reduced to during its last ever siege, of German units by the Red Army in the winter of &#x2018;44&#x2013;45. What we were in front of now was a virtual remake, just like Budapest&#x2019;s facsimile bridges<em>. </em>Not for the first time were we reminded that, sure, Europe, unlike Australia, was rich with the vestiges of medieval and classical civilization, but civilization, much like Elmer Fudd&#x2019;s constant provocation of Bugs Bunny, meant war. But it also meant feather beds, as Robert Louis Stephenson had it, even if those feather beds were to be found in an old, three-storey, red-brick (what else?), communist-era youth hostel in Gdansk, a last-night-of-the-trip-treat. We&#x2019;d made it to the city.</p>","<p>Starved of the small dramas of city life, we absorbed it all in Gdansk. In a park near the enormous Catholic Church Mariacka, enjoying a break from Alexander and Eoin who were off with the others, Tina and I noticed a middle-aged man with glasses, black hair, and a moustache opposite us, sprawled on a bench in the manner of someone whose garden the dogs of regret would soon be fouling. He had a security card lanyard around his neck. I usually have to wear one of those myself at work, but I often end up taking it off and carrying it around in my pocket instead. I admired his discipline if he could stick wearing the thing around his neck. On the other hand, if you don&#x2019;t count Frombork, I&#x2019;ve disciplined myself thus far in life to avoid ending up so out of it that I neglect my wife and kids like this poor fellow probably was. A brawny young guy sitting at the bench nearest his went over and shook him by the shoulder, offering what I took to be a few choice words advice along the lines of &#x201C;Go home to your wife and kids you bibulous disgrace.&#x201D; Drunk lanyard guy got up sharpish, looking chastised, and nodded in acknowledgment of the well-earned reproach he&#x2019;d received. He set off homeward with great purpose, feeling the keen sting of shame, before settling down on a bench a few metres away to resume his business of being unable to move. The brawny guy and his girlfriend laughed. Ah, you don&#x2019;t get this in the country.</p>","<p>At the <em>Fontanna Neptuna</em> we all took photos of each other in the sunshine. We presented Adam and Eva with a hand-carved wooden chess set by way of thanks and bought our kids new wooden swords (the Hungarian ones having been dulled with use.) We walked through the main city gate leading to the river Mot&#x142;awa (part of the Vistula delta), and stared into the black heart of the port crane building, wondering why it had to be so impenetrably dark, even in the bright sunshine.</p>","<p>That night Adam and I drank cans of Heineken and smoked on a bench in the grounds of the old hostel in the dark, talking about the trip. Everyone else was in bed. In a room, not a tent. I really had to give up the fags: it was ridiculous. I didn&#x2019;t smoke, simple as that. I&#x2018;d only started again in Greece with cousin George, and Adam had corrupted me further. Why were we even there? We hadn&#x2019;t planned on coming to Poland when we&#x2019;d sketched out our itinerary back at home. Not with so much of Spain, France, and Italy, the usual suspects, as yet unseen. Adam passed me another Heineken. &#x201C;Smoke, Rrralphy?&#x201D; We were only there because Adam and Eva had wanted the best for their kids, and had wanted their guests, us, to see their country in the best light possible.</p>","<hr>","<p>All that remained of our time in Europe was to follow the trail home: Gdansk &#x2013; Ko&#x142;obrzeg &#x2013; Berlin &#x2013; Dublin. The prospect appalled me. What if I&#x2019;d forgotten how to work in an office? What if I couldn&#x2019;t put up with the morning stand-ups and the disputes with colleagues about which JavaScript framework to use? If the kids hated school? If the weather reminded Tina why we&#x2019;d left Ireland all those years before? What if I didn&#x2019;t get a job? What did we do then?</p>","<p>As our plane slowly descended over the fields of Malahide into Dublin airport, so likewise was our big trip coming down to earth. Images from the last six months, maybe the best six months of my life, came back to me. Of cold, long streets, of fast trains, bridges with lovelocks and fig trees in gardens; of cemeteries, galleries, and concert halls. Of cats. Our poor cat. Of me, sitting on a wall by the daphne bushes waiting for the kids to come out of school, then walking them home. Freezing, then warming up slowly. Cicadas. Things going mad in Europe. Going north, and the sound of leather trousers, the smell of firewood, the taste of coffee out of a plastic cup, and vodka. A kaleidoscope of Europe.</p>","<p>We&#x2019;d made friends with ten Greek musicians, four Polish campers, two Austrian schoolkids, one Hungarian economist, and with Christmas coming, who knew what else would appear in our pear tree?</p>"]]},{"index":7,"title":"Ballinclea Heights, Killiney","pages":[["<p>Like the thousands of migrant workers at the coming of the railways in the 1840s, I poured into Dublin in pursuit of employment, a Dublin both grubbily joycean and thrillingly alien to me. In the old days, twenty years ago, Grand Canal Docks had no Dart station (the Dart is the train that runs along the southern coast of Dublin Bay) since there was nothing there worth stopping for. The docks evoked musty old names in Dubliners&#x2019; communal memory: DeValera&#x2019;s stand at Boland&#x2019;s Mill, the Grand Canal itself. Nowadays Grand Canal and the Docklands are the ground zero over which the Googlebomb had been dropped. Down the road was Facebook. Nearby, Airbnb. The Docklands is the very omphalos and bellybutton of Dublin&#x2019;s IT scene, where the Oracles of Big Data make their prophecies. In fact this Dart stop is now just known as Google Docks.</p>","<p>On the platform overlooking the Grand Canal, facing the Accenture building and its fetching plaza, I was reminded of the bend in the Spree near the Reichstag Building in Berlin. The resemblance was tenuous at best, but since Berlin was fresh in my memory, to me Dublin looked like Berlin. I needed it to look like something, since it didn&#x2019;t look like Dublin. As I descended from the platform to Barrow street I looked in at the Googlers having their free breakfast in a 14-story building, modest by, say, London standards, but a giant among men here, and no less than Google&#x2019;s European headquarters. Barrow Street made me think of a young one wheeling her wheelbarrow, selling cockles and mussels, but the cobbles here rang more to the clatter of young ones on Coke Zero Dublin Bikes on their way to their morning stand-up. My own appointment was with a job agent at VisionTech, in half an hour.</p>","<p>I started along the canal path which would take me south west around the edge of the city, a leafy artery the names of whose streets make one feel as if one is walking through a gallery of Shakespearean rogues, not a suburb in Dublin: a Clanwilliam, a Sussex, an intrigue of scheming Herberts and Percys. Here, faithful Warrington, there - disloyal Burlington! And, of course, dastardly Charlemont. A far cry from the Irish-sounding Easter Rising martyrs&#x2019; roll-call they&#x2019;ve given the streets on the inner north side of the city. Just two of the many Dublins I had to work out all over again.</p>","<p>On Wilton Terrace I sat down beside Patrick Kavanagh just to listen to the canal. Not that it made much noise at all, but I wanted to see if that particular silence would bring me back. I felt like I should have been eating cheese sandwiches and listening to some grunge band on my walkman. At Leeson Bridge I took my leave of the canal and made along Adelaide Road, turning right at Earlsfort Terrace, home of the National Concert Hall, where Mum occasionally went to hear Malian guitarists and the like, and where I&#x2019;d occasionally gone to high-art extravaganzas, like the time I&#x2019;d seen a screening of <em>The Battleship Potemkin</em> with live orchestral accompaniment, in my student days. There&#x2019;d been a lot of Chinese cinema in the afternoon back then. Afternoons in The Long Hall waiting for evening lectures that we dozed through, before retiring to The Junction. Could I still pull off the aesthetic lifestyle? I could, I thought. I just had to get a job first. We estimated we could last until Christmas with no money coming in, but no longer. If we wanted to do what we&#x2019;d said we&#x2019;d do, what we&#x2019;d planned for so long to do, what we&#x2019;d told our friends, our kids, and ourselves we were going to do - spend a year and a half in Europe - then I had to get on my bike.</p>","<hr>","<p>I was glad to be home, and I didn&#x2019;t want to be home. We were all glad to see Mum again of course, and she was glad to see us, kind of. We hadn&#x2019;t seen the old girl for a couple of months, not since that warm evening I&#x2019;d driven her to Zakynthos airport for her evening flight home. We&#x2019;d inched her suitcase forward with our feet for half an hour over the marble floor of the departure hall before everyone in the queue had been informed that the flight was cancelled. Along with everyone else poor Mum had been whisked, anti-climatically, to say the least, off to a hotel to wait it out overnight even though her true home, if she was going to stay on the island, was with us back at Koukla House.</p>","<p>We settled into Mum&#x2019;s house, Tina and I taking my old childhood bedroom. The kids got their own each. Almost immediately we had to get them into school, once again. This time, though, it&#x2019;d be for the full school year. Mum had tried to get them in somewhere we&#x2019;d all thought would be ideal but there hadn&#x2019;t been space. She tried another, then another. In the end the only one that would take them was in an area that, not to put too fine a point on it, wasn&#x2019;t the most salubrious part of Dublin. When she told us back in Brisbane we&#x2019;d had no choice but to accept.</p>"],["<p>In economic limbo we might have been, and our grand European journey on hiatus, but we could still travel around Ireland itself and go to places which, if we ever thought about at all when last we lived there over ten years ago, we would have dismissed as the sorts of places tourists went to. Back then, a few years into the &#x2018;Celtic Tiger&#x2019; era, the new Ireland had sushi trains in the foodie quarter behind Grafton Street (or, as the marketers, and no-one else, called it, the &#x2018;Purple Flag Area&#x2019;) and exciting new developments like the International Financial Services Centre, opposite Custom House. It had new roads, paid for by the Germans, bypassing midlands towns like Loughrea and Moate, to expedite the passage of Celtic Tiger Dubs to the Galway Races or Doolin Surf Festival. Even the ferry to the Arans was a fancy catamaran built in Perth, Australia, with TVs and wifi, last time we went out: a far cry from the odoriferous fishing ketch Dad and I endured to to get out there in 1982. This time around we were tourists, so we picked touristy places, like Ferns Castle in Co. Wexford, to take the kids to.</p>","<p>When I was 16, I set off on my bike one summer morning from my home in Killiney (Mum&#x2019;s) with my friend Andrew. We got to Bray soon enough, and since it was still early we decided to keep going down the east coast of Wicklow. We reached Wicklow town after a couple of hours and kept going, because we were young and still had hours of daylight. By Arklow town, sixty kilometres from home and within shouting distance of the Wexford border, we thought we&#x2019;d better leave it at that, so we turned around and cycled home. Of course none of our parents had a clue where we were. Nowadays I could barely pedal that much in three days, never mind one. Luckily, I didn&#x2019;t have to. Mum was out west on a bridge trip so we had the use of her car. There&#x2019;s a new motorway, the M11, that shadows the Wicklow coast from just past Newtownmountkennedy, Ireland&#x2019;s Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, which goes past Wicklow and Arklow and deep into Wexford. On a Saturday morning shortly after arriving back in Ireland, with blue skies lined with white streaks of clouds, that&#x2019;s what we did. This was the Ireland we were on a mission to see.</p>","<p>Ferns lies only a mile or two past the end of the motorway. It&#x2019;s as if they built all this infrastructure just to deliver Southsiders to the Anglo-Norman heart of Ireland. We made our way straight to the town castle where a guy called Graham seemed to be waiting just for us. Since we were the only ones there, ol&#x2019; Graham was interested in knowing how we&#x2019;d found out about the place. TripAdvisor and Lonely Planet library books. He showed us a fantastic tapestry made in 1997 &#x201C;by a group of local ladies to relate the story of the town in stitch work&#x201D;. More towns should have tapestries of their hostory, preferably woven by local ladies. Graham then took us outside and sat us on a bench right outside the moat and what remained of the eight-hundred year old castle (not much) and told us about Dermot MacMurrough and his fateful appeal to Strongbow for help against the local kings. That fateful appeal is seen as the start of the long involvement of Britain in Ireland&#x2019;s affairs. Al and Eoin absorbed all the horrible history on offer - sieges, crossbows, even exploding lime bombs - in awed silence.</p>","<p>It hadn&#x2019;t looked like much from the outside, but one of the four original towers was still intact enough to be climbed up and into. There was an impressive amount of structure and ornamentation, given the state, indeed the absence, of much of the rest of the compound. In the tiny chapel halfway up the tower Graham pointed out the carved gargoyle-like minor deities leering down on those who, their attention drifting during prayers, might innocently glance up at the roof in boredom. Emerging into the daylight at the top of the tower, with Mount Leinster a few miles west on the Carlow border, I promised myself there and then to learn more about the history of my own country.</p>","<p>In Enniscorthy&#x2019;s Market Square under a commemorative statue to the rebel events of 1798 we picnicked on sandwiches in the lee of Vinegar Hill. Enniscorthy is &#x201C;the finest place in the world,&#x201D; somebody - it may even have been Joyce himself - said in <em>Ulysses</em>. No disrespect, like, but I disagree. At the river Slaney&#x2019;s delta at Wexford town we pressed on to the deep south of the county, down to the very end of Hook peninsula, the apogee of the day&#x2019;s drive. You could see the easternmost part of the coast of county Waterford across the water. Near that spot, on the other side of Hook peninsula, was where the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland began with the landing in 1169.</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>&#x2018;At Baginbun, Ireland was lost and won&#x2019;</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>Hook Lighthouse, &#x201C;the oldest operational lighthouse in the world&#x201D;, according to the Wexford Heritage Trail people, sits up on an arrangement of limestone outcrops that make for eminently walkable and climbable steps and layers. I didn&#x2019;t notice any seals, dolphins, or whales, but there were a few brave scuba divers. For over eight-hundred years this lighthouse has been here, at the mouth of the Three Sisters river system, doing its stalwart utmost for the area, &#x201C;the graveyard of a thousand ships.&#x201D;</p>"],["<p>Tina and I dropped Alexander and Eoin off at their Irish dancing lessons in Dalkey, the coastal village a kilometre downhill from Mum&#x2019;s, and one of the prettier spots in all of Dublin. It has seven-hundred-year-old castles on its winding main street, centuries-old harbours, pubs that used to have stocks outside, and its fair share of celebrity residents. It still feels like a village, despite long ago having been entirely subsumed into the capital. With the kids safely hopping and lepping, we strolled down to Coliemore harbours. As the weeks passed, the options for the sort of job I could apply for were narrowing since we had a hard deadline of the end of next June to leave Ireland, and that was beginning to weigh on us. The kids would have finished the school year, and we&#x2019;d want to be on the road back through Europe by then. That was the optimistic scenario. The doomsday one would be having to leave in the new year.</p>","<p>&#x201C;We can definitely last till Christmas,&#x201D; Tina said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s always been part of the plan to have a European Christmas. I don&#x2019;t think we should go before then. But I think that&#x2019;ll be it.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll get something, don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201D; was all I could come up with. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s always like this looking for a job. We know that. The thing is not to panic.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not panicking, just preparing.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Something&#x2019;ll come up. I&#x2019;ll give Cormac a call tomorrow. He sounded hopeful.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Cormac was an agent I&#x2019;d spoken to about a job who&#x2019;d sounded quite hopeful about my prospects, but then job agents always do. He probably sounded hopeful to all the candidates he was sending forward for the same job. And all the agents in the other recruitment agencies sending their guys forward for that same particular job probably aimed to instill confidence in their candidates by sounding hopeful as well. Truly a wonderful time to be alive, what with all that hope going around.</p>","<p>Howth lay straight across Dublin bay, a lumpy reflection of the coast we were on. Dalkey Island, lair of goats, rats and rabbits, was right in front of us. As well as a good-looking ruin of an old church, the island has a Martello Tower, one of over a dozen of the would-be defenses against Napoleon along this stretch of the bay. We&#x2019;d already been to the one in Sandycove, the one James Joyce lived in, the one he used for the strange opening scene of <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding country and the awaking mountains.</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>It would have spoiled the moment to ever come out and say it to Tina, but I didn&#x2019;t fancy my chances too much of finding employment. It can take me three months to get a job back in Brisbane, and that&#x2019;s on home ground. The last time I&#x2019;d worked here in the surrounding country of Ireland at a job that was in any way relevant to what I was looking for now was a good while back when I took a summer job at the tourist shop at the famous Long Room in Trinity College. There were entire days spent in the back room just rolling up Book of Kells posters and pricing W.B. Yeats anthologies. I loved it - I had first dibs on books that I wouldn&#x2019;t normally have looked at twice but for some reason there I wanted to read. That summer I had time to absorb them. It made me appreciate the worn and grubby city around me all the more. I&#x2019;d go for walks to St Michan&#x2019;s Church and even to the dilapidated docklands. And all of it utterly irrelevant to the business of getting hired, now, as a web developer.</p>","<p>By early October I&#x2019;d only managed to get one interview, and that was a phone one. A C# (the programming language, not the musical note) developer working for Citibank asked me some questions over Skype about dependency injection and test driven development. If by accident Skype had suddenly flipped to video mode, he would have seen a man hunched over a bar heater in his Mum&#x2019;s house, unshaven and cold, straining hard to hear the questions over a laggy connection. If he then had asked the standard interview question: &#x201C;Why are you interested in working for Citibank?&#x201D; the man, if he was being honest, would have answered:</p>","<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not, I just want to keep the journey going.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Back in Dalkey, we stopped in for a Guinness and a cider in Finnegan&#x2019;s, one of our old haunts.

Ireland is fast becoming a hub for Fintech.</em></p>","<p>Something did come up, just like I said it would. Tina shouldn&#x2019;t have worried. And I should have been allowed that Guinness and crisps. One morning, picking up red apples in Mum&#x2019;s garden, my phone rang. One of my agents, Fintan from Ballymena, Co. Donegal, told me I was the preferred candidate for a role I&#x2019;d interviewed for on the quays a couple of days earlier. His mellifluous Northern Irish voice sang out the details of the six-month contract I&#x2019;d just won, which would only leave me short for our departure date two months. Considering it was the only actual face-to-face interview I&#x2019;d managed to score in the two months we&#x2019;d been here, it was as good as I could have expected. The job was in the renovated docklands part of town, which was also as good as I could have hoped for. I had turned down an interview in an industrial estate, which may well have have been for a decent enough job, but I hadn&#x2019;t come all this way to spend most of my waking hours in one of those estates. The docklands, on the other hand, would be perfect. I could resume my lunchtime explorations of the city after all these years.</p>","<p>That phonecall from honey-voiced Fintan was one of the moments when our trip turned on its heel. One minute you&#x2019;re stashing apples in a Dunne&#x2019;s bag, the next you&#x2019;re a conquering hero, planning raids back onto mainland Europe. The kids would see out the year in school here after all. We&#x2019;d see more of Europe; we&#x2019;d see more of Ireland. A window of gloriousness and late autumn splendour opened up for us that very moment, made even better when young Fintan said they wanted me to hang on for two weeks before starting. I wasn&#x2019;t too big for my boots to finish the job Mum had set me, though, not if we wanted apple crumble that night.</p>","<hr>","<p>Alexander and Eoin were on their mid-term break. They&#x2019;d been coming home from school speaking Irish words, and this being the one hundred year anniversary of the Easter Rising, singing rebel songs too. They&#x2019;d even learned the National Anthem. I could hum my way through it, but it had been a loooong time since I&#x2019;d learned the words:</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>Sinne Fianna F&#xE1;il, at&#xE1; faoi gheall ag &#xC9;irinn&#x2026; </p>\n</blockquote>","<p>One song that Eoin was learning stuck out in particular. <em>Grace</em> had often been on the radio when I was a kid, but I&#x2019;d dismissed it then, much as I&#x2019;d dismissed almost everything to do with my own native musical culture too, other than Thin Lizzy and The Boomtown Rats. That&#x2019;s just what little bollixes like me did, and it probably broke my Dad&#x2019;s heart. We hated learning Irish in school and dismissing anything to do with tradition was our revenge. Mum was from Dublin, and didn&#x2019;t seem to care too much about trad music and Irish and the GAA (Gaelic football and hurling) but Dad was from Connemara, in county Galway, and probably took it more personally. Now, though, hearing Eoin&#x2019;s innocent and clear voice just made me want to learn it and play <em>Grace</em> with him:</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>As we gather in the chapel here in old Kilmainham gaol,\nI think about the last few weeks, oh, will they say we&#x2019;ve failed?</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>So in the expectation now of actually lasting through the winter we joined a traditional Irish music organisation called <em>Comhaltas Ceolt&#xF3;ir&#xED; &#xC9;ireann. </em>For the benefit of the non-<em>Gaeilgeoir</em>s (Irish speakers) amongst us, we reduced that mouthful to <em>Ceoiltas</em> (kee-<em>ole</em>-tas), since the Irish for music is <em>ceoil</em> (kee-<em>ole</em>). We had always wanted this trip to be a musical one and so far, with the <em>mandolinada</em> of Zakynthos and the campfires of Pomerania fresh in our memories, we&#x2019;d had plenty of music. Now it was Dublin&#x2019;s turn. Friday nights became music nights. Whenever we could we drove to Monkstown, a distinctly anglo part of south Dublin, ironically enough, and in the Ceoiltas house in a Georgian terrace in Belgrave Square we distributed ourselves into four different classrooms: Eoin into the guitar class, Alexander the violin, Tina the concertina, and me the Irish conversation one, which was run by an old lady from Ballyferriter called M&#xE1;ire who was a communist, or at the very least, a hard-leftie.</p>","<p>Taking further advantage of the window that had opened for us we found a Dutch old-timer called Bert on couchsurfing who lived just outside Abbeyfeale, in the county of Kerry, or &#x2018;The Kingdom&#x2019;, as they called it down there, who accepted our request to stay with him. The Kingdom was far enough away to make it worthwhile for an upcoming bank holiday weekend.</p>","<p>Simon and Gina were two travel-blogging Aussies Tina had been following in preparation for our trip, and when she read that they and their kids were leaving Ireland after a year or so for a housesitting stint in France, she asked if we could meet them to pick their brains before they left. One of the tips they gave us was that King John&#x2019;s Castle in Limerick was definitely worth a visit. That gave us something to do en route to Bert.</p>","<p>A claw-hand wind scraped over King&#x2019;s Island, the nucleus around which the layers of Limerick city had accreted over the past half millennium like a pearl in an oyster. At King John&#x2019;s Alexander and Eoin ran around like pillaging norsemen, up and down ramparts and spiral staircases, all in search of these (sort-of) hidden plaque tokens they had to make rubbings from on the leaflet given to them at reception - the geniuses who think of these things! - if they wanted to win a multicoloured rubber with &#x2018;King John&#x2019;s Castle, Limerick&#x2019; on it. Wrapped up against the cold, I stood on the ramparts looking out over the Shannon towards the airport on the Clare side of the river, remembering the times I used to come down to pick up Tina when we were a-courtin&#x2019;. In those days she lived in Notting Hill and used to fly from Stansted to Shannon. Having driven down from Clifden I&#x2019;d pick her up and drive us both through Clare back to Connemara. Those were the days.</p>","<p>From King John&#x2019;s - which certainly had been worth the diversion - we pressed on Bertward, deep into the badlands of Limerick. With the light of the day gone, we pulled in and claimed a table in Mat McCoy&#x2019;s on the main street of Abbeyfeale and stocked &#x2018;er up with Guinness and Tayto crisps. The Rugby World Cup was not something that we&#x2019;d normally pay much attention to, but since Ireland had been knocked out by Argentina in the quarter-finals we weren&#x2019;t going to pass up the chance to see Australia serve up some tasty revenge to the South Americans in the semis. They say &#x2018;You can&#x2019;t beat Banagher&#x2019;, but sitting there with a pint, a pack of Tayto, and a Sunday paper, and with the Wallabies savaging the Pumas on the TV, we came pretty close to Banagher-level greatness that Sunday afternoon in Matt McCoy&#x2019;s.</p>","<p>The very last of the day&#x2019;s driving took us out of Abbeyfeale town, over the river Feale itself, and into The Kingdom. It was a good trick finding Bert&#x2019;s cottage up a boreen in the dark, but there it was, the one with the Ciarra&#xED; (Kerry) yellow and green flying outside, just like he&#x2019;d said. The friendly giant Dutchman welcomed us inside to where a fire had been lit and dinner prepared. Once again we thought to ourselves how inadequate and misleading the term &#x2018;couchsurfing&#x2019; was, how it didn&#x2019;t at all do the hospitality we were once again receiving justice. Our &#x2018;couch&#x2019; was our own room, the kids&#x2019; their own too (with the added thrill of a bunk bed). We even had our own private bathroom and shower.</p>","<p>Bert sat us down and fed us food for an overcast day - mashed potato and meatballs - and was liberal in his application of olives and red wine to the situation. He had a roguishly well-trimmed moustache. Not too many of those in Kerry, I was guessing. So what brought him from Helmond, near Eindhoven, to here?</p>","<p>&#x201C;Years ago I came here for a holiday with my wife. We both loved it. We drove everywhere, and in fact we used to use couchsurfing ourselves. Irish people helped us a lot. My wife used to say that she felt like she&#x2019;d &#x2018;come home&#x2019;. When it was time to leave she was in tears. We made a plan to buy a place in Ireland.&#x201D;</p>","<p>He topped each of our wine glasses up.</p>","<p>&#x201C;In the first year we came out twice, the second year three times, the third year four times,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;And by the time I finally found a place, I came out alone.&#x201D;</p>","<p>He left his story at that, and we didn&#x2019;t press for details. He got up and dug out some kids&#x2019; books for Alexander and Eoin, a Dutch pronunciation guidance for me, since I&#x2019;d mentioned I was half-beginning to think about learning Dutch, and then he helped us decide what to see and do over the weekend. The Gap of Dunloe was our first choice, but it&#x2019;d depend on the weather. In the morning a buffet-type breakfast such as you&#x2019;d receive at a B&amp;B for &#x20AC;70 per night was laid on, while we with disquiet considered the soft day that was in it outside the window as we got ready to go out. You don&#x2019;t go west for the weather; everybody knows that. Still, we seemed to have been quite unlucky.</p>","<p>Bypassing Killarney and its lake, a corner of Ireland I barely knew, at mid-morning we pulled in at Kate Kearney&#x2019;s Cottage, the famous old shebeen at the head of the Gap of Dunloe. The weather was still on our side, but only just. We&#x2019;d do as much of the Gap as we could on foot till the kids or the weather wore us down. Sky-high waterfalls lined our way, and steep slopes of scree were testament to the ever-changing face of the hillside. Standing aside to let a jaunting car pass us by at the Wishing Bridge, I felt mighty, like we could have walked the whole thing that morning, and with fight to spare. Many&#x2019;s the purple-patched sheep we disturbed, and still the pony traps clopped past us every now and again going into the deeps of the Gap, a weather-worried look knitting the occupants&#x2019; brows. Somewhere up ahead of us lay Ireland&#x2019;s highest mountain, Carrauntoohil. But the wind howling over the river Loe between the Reeks and Purple Mountain had the better of us after about an hour of it, so we turned back once we&#x2019;d reached Auger lake, regaining the sanctuary of Kate Kearney&#x2019;s just in time, weather-wise, where we sat down and ate with Asian tourists, listening to <em>Star of the County Down</em>.</p>","<p>After lunch, and the rain really coming down now, we went from nine to three on the clock of Lough Leane. Ross Castle is a sentinel at the head of Ross Island, an island in name only. With a troupe of French holiday-makers we were guided around the smallish fort, which came with the by-now-familiar complement of murder holes, garde-robes, and arrow-slit windows. As if Graham had followed us all the way from Ferns there, our guide that day guide continued in the general vein of how entertainingly awful peoples&#x2019; lives were centuries ago.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Can you imagine being slathered in goose fat to keep out the cold like they were in medieval times?&#x201D; the guide asked Alexander and Eoin. They had to admit they couldn&#x2019;t. I couldn&#x2019;t. No-one there could possibly imagine what that&#x2019;s like. Or imagine sticking your arse out the side of a castle to take a crap. Think of the cold. The crows. Thankfully, there was little need for goose fat or bums out windows (not if we wanted a good review on couchsurfing, anyway) back in Bert&#x2019;s warm cottage, where Celtic Soul CDs and bowls of chocolate mint sticks were waiting for us to take the edge off the cold and drizzle.</p>","<p>In Birr, in the county of Offaly, the last of our castles we&#x2019;d see on our weekend break was the least warlike, the least murderous, the most scientific, had the nicest garden, and had the most impressive telescope of the lot. Birr Castle&#x2019;s <em>Leviathan</em> was the biggest telescope in the world for seventy years but has long since been put out to pasture. Nowadays it sits out in the pretty gardens, which we ambled around after a tour of the science centre. Looking more like it belonged to the same class of objects as the Great War&#x2019;s <em>Big Bertha</em> than that of Hubble or the Spitzer space telescope, it was interesting, in this age of miniaturisation, to see a thing so solid and bricky, the culmination of the process of enlargement which telescopes must needs pursue in their insatiable lust for light.</p>","<hr>","<p>The heather of Kerry, dripping with the rain and buffeted by the wind, was a long way away that Monday morning, where on the ancient and irregular pavements of the redeveloped Docklands quays the IT professionals came and went. Tough inner-city seagulls scattered at the approach of PHP and Java programmers clattering along Sir John Rogerson&#x2019;s Quay on Dublin Bikes, every now and then hitting a patch of exposed <em>Strumpet City</em>-era cobblestone under the broken tarmac. The wind beat the sails of the reconstructed famine ship <em>Jeanie Johnston</em> on the far side of the river, worrying the surface of the Owen Liffey. These quays, no longer meant for working boats but rather boats that thought they were restaurants, hosted brand-new designer bridges, pop-up coffee stalls running on diesel generators, and campshire (the bit of the quay between the water and the road) sushi restaurants. I vaguely remembered it all from a generation ago when I was a photography student, wandering these quays with an eye for the sort of textured squalor that would look good with the grainy Ilford HP5 film I loved using. My fingers constantly smelled of developer, stop bath, and fixer in those days.</p>","<p>A quartet of business analysts in casual attire coming out of Caf&#xE9; Parigi passed me as I entered. On the counter lay brochures touting the area&#x2019;s trendy new name: the SOBO district, the district South Of Beckett and O&#x2019;Casey, since as well as being writers, those two have lent their names to the two new bridges more or less at the heart of the Dockland redevelopment. I took my coffee, went outside, and walked across the street and up the steps of The Observatory, the curious name of the office building on Sir John Rogerson&#x2019;s Quay, to start my new job.</p>"]]},{"index":8,"title":"Claude Debussystraat, Anderlecht","pages":[["<p>Ruben Brondeel was in a restaurant in Anderlecht with a friend one night in October when he got a notification on his phone of a couchsurfing request for the beginning of December. A family with two young boys was quite different to the sort of request he usually got: single travellers, or at most a couple. But four people in his flat? Two of them kids?</p>","<hr>","<p>I hadn&#x2019;t been to Brussels for twenty years; Tina and the kids, never. As Christmas approached I heard people at work talking about going to Christmas markets on the continent, and Brussels was one of a handful of places I heard mentioned. We went looking for a host on couchsurfing.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know exactly what I will be doing that weekend, but hosting shouldn&#x2019;t be a problem. We can arrange more in detail somewhere in the beginning of December?&#x201D; Ruben replied, sounding familiarly Australian?</p>","<p>Terrorists attacked Paris on the 13th of November, a side effect of which was to jeopardise our planned trip to Belgium. It seemed like us being there might coincide with the authorities&#x2019; clampdown in Molenbeek, the suburb beside Anderlecht. Incredibly, Brussels, Europe&#x2019;s de facto capital, a place where not much happens, &#x2018;went into lockdown&#x2019;. Late-night police raids were carried out to target a cell of tiresome rageboys, the sort that had been plaguing Europe&#x2019;s house throughout the year, connected to the one that carried out the Paris attacks. There were more raids near Li&#xE8;ge in the east, and in Charleroi, south of the capital. Charleroi to us was no more than a waypoint we used once to get from Dublin to Zakynthos on Ryanair. Let them raid it. But who wants to visit a city with soldiers skulking around the tourist quarter, helicopters menacing overhead, and the metro shut down? The police had evacuated restaurants in the famous Rue des Bouchers in the centre of Brussels, blocked off roads, and closed schools, much to the delight of children and terrorists. On the Sunday morning of the lockdown the market at the city&#x2019;s Eurostar terminal Gare du Midi &#x2013; one of the biggest outdoor markets in Europe &#x2013; was called off. Brussels quickly became a city where one might well find oneself - <em>quelle horreur</em>, like - unable even to purchase a waffle or a Mannekin Pis souvenir. We wrote to Ruben again towards the end of November:</p>","<p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s it like there now? Will the Christmas markets take place, do you think?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Brussels has had better weeks. The metro is running again and tomorrow they will decide what they will do with the Christmas market. And actually, there is not really a locked centre, there is only a lot of police and some soldiers. I&#x2019;ll even have dinner at the city centre tonight. Anyway, I&#x2019;ll keep you posted about the Christmas market.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Two days later, in which we&#x2019;d contemplated alternative Christmas market towns like Koln or Strasbourg, he got back to us: &#x201C;As promised an update about the Christmas market: it opens today and it will take place as foreseen. Everything in the city centre seems to be again as before the attacks in Paris. Also, yesterday the &#x2018;terror level index&#x2019; dropped from 4 to 3. That is still higher than normal, but more in line with the neighbouring country&#x2019;s.&#x201D; He meant France. <em>M&#xEA;me pas peur</em>, as they said there - we were going.</p>","<hr>","<p>Ruben met us straight off the airport train at Gare Centrale. He was tall, thin, and had near-perfect English. As well as being a computer hardware engineer he was studying for a degree in philosophy in his spare time. On the one hand, I would have preferred his English to be more like Bela&#x2019;s Mum so I could speak more French. On the other hand, with couchsurfing stays you want communication between you and the other party to be as clear as a Greek sky in June, and his English was superior to my French.</p>","<p>&#x201C;In Brussels, French is the language of the street,&#x201D; he explained, &#x201C;but people often speak Dutch at home. The culture in Brussels is different to the rest of Flanders. A lot of people see it almost as a foreign city.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s certainly how I see it.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;No, I mean Belgian people.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Too late to do anything remotely Brusselly that first evening, we went straight back to his flat. His front room, where we&#x2019;d be quartered, as in accommodated, not cut up into pieces for treason (although the weekend was still young), had a flat screen TV which didn&#x2019;t get switched on once while we were there and a nice big sofa bed with fluffy pillows and pouffes. It was all ours for the weekend. Ruben himself normally slept downstairs, since (as we&#x2019;d soon find out) the wooden floor belonging to the unusually carpetless Turkish family upstairs could get a little clattery, come nighttime.</p>","<p>Once we&#x2019;d unburdened ourselves of our luggage we headed out again for takeaway frites and croquettes at a chip van down the road and took them back to his place. He placed a selection of bottles of strong beers on the table: Duval, Chimay, some 11% Trappist stuff - all tasty, all deadly. The funny thing is, the more Trappist you have, the more you talk. Isn&#x2019;t it ironic? When Tina and the kids went to bed I chanced some French with Ruben and to his credit he took my lead without batting an eyelid. For the rest of the weekend, all I had to do was say something in French to him and he&#x2019;d follow suit and stay &#x2018;in character&#x2019; as long as I did. This, despite the fact that as a <em>Flamand</em> his mother tongue is actually Dutch. But come on, this is Babel - I mean Brussels - so he worked in both Dutch and French, and happened to be fluent in English too. It&#x2019;s sickening how accomplished some people are.</p>","<p>Considering the nearest metro stop was called Bizet, the one before it Jacques Brel, and the street we were on Claude Debussystraat, I asked Ruben what sort of music he liked.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Do you know Stromae? It&#x2019;s &#x2018;maestro&#x2019; spelled backwards, kind of.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Big he might have been in Belgium but I&#x2019;d never heard of him. (I can&#x2019;t name a single Jacques Brel song either, to my shame). Opening another Duval each, we watched one of Stromae&#x2019;s videos, &#x2018;<em>Formidable&#x2019;</em>, where he pretends to be drunk &#x2013; I&#x2019;ve done that loads of times myself &#x2013; and sings <em>en plein Bruxelles</em>, at least until the <em>flics</em> come and ask him what he thinks he&#x2019;s up to. But they do so nicely, because of course they know exactly who he is. They even admit to being big fans. Nice video. 131 million views, and shot just down the road from where we were.</p>"],["<p>Saturday dawned, a grey day with a spattering of light rain doing us no favours. Ruben told us about a good caf&#xE9; called <em>Le Pain Quotidien</em> near &#xC9;glise Sainte Catherine and the Bourse. By the time we got into town, found <em>Le Pain, </em>got a table, and eventually ordered (for me, <em>le Manhattan</em>: <em>&#x153;uf bio &#xE0; la coque, saumon fum&#xE9;, ricotta, baguette bio</em>) I could have eaten a horse, bio or not. There was a communal round wooden table in the middle where people conversed, probably &#x2013; given the level 3 alert still in place &#x2013; about <em>l&#x2019;&#xE9;quilibre entre s&#xE9;curit&#xE9; et libert&#xE9;s</em>, heady stuff like that that francophones love. The boys ate croissants, I had the newspaper, and we were having breakfast in Brussels. Oh look, here comes my coffee. <em>Formidable</em>, just like the Stromae song.</p>","<p>What was in that day&#x2019;s <em>Le Soir</em> (&#x201C;1er journal &#xE0; Bruxelles&#x201D;)? An interview with the mayor of Brussels, Charles Michel, in which he said that the decision to shut down the town centre last month was the hardest of his life, but it had been necessary to keep one&#x2019;s cool &#x2013; <em>la necessit&#xE9; de garder son sang-froid</em> &#x2013; in the face of the terrorist threat. At that very moment in Paris, &#x201C;<em>rudes n&#xE9;gociations entre 195 pays</em>&#x201D; were going on at COP21, the summit on global warming. Either there was a lot of name-calling and swearing on the way to a deal or <em>rude</em> has a meaning in French I wasn&#x2019;t aware of.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Come children, we have to make our way to the Heysel plateau, to the north of the city.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;But father&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Come now, child. Finish up&#x201D;</p>","<p>The Atomium (which comes from &#x2018;atom&#x2019; + &#x2018;aluminium&#x2019;, the metal they switched to mid-construction) was the main pavilion of the Brussels World Fair of 1958, a space-age icon that outlasted everything else. I&#x2019;d been to it before, on one or other of my previous visits to Brussels; I just hadn&#x2019;t gone into it. Or had I? I couldn&#x2019;t remember. How interesting my life must be to make me forget whether I&#x2019;d ever climbed into an atom of iron, scaled-up 165 billion times. That&#x2019;s what happens as you get older and accumulate more and more experiences - you just forget about yesterday&#x2019;s molecules. It all felt quite Robbie the Robot inside, a vision of what the future was going to look like 60 years ago. If Brussels is the new Paris, which it isn&#x2019;t, but if it was, then this, surely, was its Eiffel Tower.</p>","<p>And now it&#x2019;s time for one of my favourite verbs: <em>fl&#xE2;ner</em>. It means to walk around with no fixed goal, opportunistically taking the most promising-looking path at each fork in the road. Someone who does that is a <em>fl&#xE2;neur</em>. Well, we <em>fl&#xE2;nned</em> the afternoon away pleasantly in the touristy streets around the famous Mannekin Pis statue, orbiting in a circle of ever-diminishing radius until, like a furiously swirling eddy of flushed water, we merged with a noisy, excited crowd at the crossroads where the diminutive &#x2013; in stature, but not pulling power &#x2013; statue, clad all in a green football top that day, pisses eternal.</p>","<p>We got cajoled into a Sicilian pizza place nearby by one of those smooth bastards, who, once you&#x2019;re inside, praises your every choice of wine and salad as if you were the food critic from <em>Le Monde</em> rather than someone who just picked the cheapest thing they knew Alexander and Eoin would eat with the least fuss. Ruben had told us earlier that if he managed to get through his studies in time he&#x2019;d meet us back near the Sainte Catherine, and sure enough he did. In a beer hall called Les Halles de Saint-G&#xE9;ry which used to be a meat market, our all-time favourite Belgian person told us that if it seemed busy to us outside (it did), well, we should have seen it last year. Numbers were down. It was terrible what had happened in Paris, and shocking to have read about Brussels being shut down as the hysteria about Molenbeek caused such panic. But it was hard to think of all of that sitting there in Les Halles, sipping the first of the day and chatting. I asked ruben him why he hosted people.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, I suppose it started with my love of hiking. I&#x2019;ve actually been to Dublin and done most of the Wicklow Way. And of course I use Couchsurfing when I&#x2019;m travelling, too. Do you know the scouts?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Kind of. I was a boy scout when I was younger.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been involved in the scouting movement for years. Just until a couple of years ago I was the head of the nationwide scouting movement. Nowadays I&#x2019;m in a program where adults spend time with kids from Afghanistan who have arrived in Belgium with no parents. Actually, I&#x2019;ll be leaving the house early tomorrow morning to help one of my friends take a bunch of kids out to the country. Some of these kids live in Molenbeek. They&#x2019;re not well off, they live in small flats, and they don&#x2019;t get a chance to play. It&#x2019;s funny, but often when we take them to the countryside it&#x2019;s the first time they&#x2019;ve been outside Brussels; the first time they&#x2019;ve seen a cow.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Now that he mentioned cows, I couldn&#x2019;t be sure that Al and Eoin had ever seen more than a fistful of cows themselves. Before I could ask them however, Ruben had a suggestion.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Alors, on va aux march&#xE9;s?</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>Good idea. That&#x2019;s why we were here, after all: to see the Christmas markets.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Bon. Allons-y.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>At around 7:15 that evening, two things happened. 1) After two weeks of rude negotiations, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius brought down the green-topped gavel to announce the historic agreement between the 196 countries attending COP21, and 2) we hit the <em>March&#xE9;s de Noel</em> at Saint Catherine&#x2019;s. After all the talk about closing the markets, all the stuff in Molenbeek, all the fallout from Paris, all the fear - we&#x2019;d made it. The presence of pairs of camouflaged soldiers with machine guns here and there couldn&#x2019;t dampen the bonhomie of the Christmas atmosphere. It wasn&#x2019;t even particularly cold. We walked in the crowds amongst the twin rows of chalets, or <em>barraques</em> as they sometimes call them, on the <em>March&#xE9; aux Poissons Vismet</em>, over the covered-up pond and silenced fountain, stopping frequently to get <em>vin chaud</em>, <em>gaufres &#xE0; la white chocolate</em> (a disgusting combination, actually), shots of <em>rakimelo</em> at a euro a pop and going fast at a Greek stand where we chatted to a couple of heads from Crete, chocolate whatnots for my Mum, and finally a selection of spirits on a wooden tray which Ruben scored while the kids queued up to go into the terrible mouth of the &#x2018;ice monster&#x2019; to be shat out, exhilarated, five minutes later.</p>","<p>We got the Metro home, passing all the musical stops, and the atmosphere in the carriage was as you&#x2019;d expect it to be on a Saturday night at the beginning of the Christmas season. It was hard to remember that the city centre had all but shut down recently after the Paris terror attacks. Ruben showed Alexander and Eoin a game called <em>Carcassonne (</em>yes, the medieval town in the south of France), while Tina and I tried not to doze off in our chairs, a Duval each by our side.</p>"],["<p>Leaving a tidy front room behind us and the keys to the flat on the table, we left our friend Ruben&#x2019;s and walked through Anderlecht one last time. Surfacing from the metro at Gare Centrale we strealed around a dead part of town near the Parc de Bruxelles in the light rain until we came upon an oasis in the form of a massive bookshop called Filigranes. All life was there. Its narrow laneways between towers of bestsellers made it feel like the old part of a European city. A pianist played The Shins. After a slice of quiche and an Americain each, we bought the kids <em>Carcassonne, </em>their new favourite game. Go there, you won&#x2019;t regret it: <em>Filigranes</em>, Boulevard du R&#xE9;gent, at Arts-loi metro stop.</p>","<p>Just in case the boys thought Brussels was going to be all chocolate, board games, and micturating cherubs, we asked them if they could give us a hand lifting the bonnet so we could all peer into the very engine of Europe. How exactly does the European Parliament work? They could hardly wait to find out. The Parlamentarium sounds like something Bill Bryson would make fun of, a visitors&#x2019; centre in the <em>Quartier Europ&#xE9;en</em> that explains the workings of something most people aren&#x2019;t interested in finding out the workings of. In <em>Neither Here nor There (</em>the book I got in Berlin) he was harsh on Brussels in it, so there&#x2019;s no reason to believe he would have spared The Parlamentarium the lash of his pen had it existed when he passed through. But it&#x2019;s new, so it didn&#x2019;t. And guess what, we loved it. The kids love anything to do with maps, flags, history, nations and their wars (at that stage they&#x2019;d been to about a dozen European countries) so they took to it quickly. The highlight was probably the auditorium, which puts one in the middle of a European Parliament voting session. I recognised the floppy-haired Guy Verhofstadt, the guy who verbally (but playfully) pistol-whipped Greek PM Alexis Tsipras while we were in Zakynthos in a speech which I showed the kids on YouTube at the time. You can &#x2018;meet&#x2019; all 751 MEPs, but I voted to have a beer in the caf&#xE9; instead. Tina and I stimulated consumer spending by letting the kids buy tat from the shop. Stirring stuff, all this bureaucracy, you might think. But it is stirring; moving even, especially the early parts of the exhibition explaining the all-too-obvious reasons for the formation of the EU in the aftermath of WWII, and the containment of Germany, and the subsequent &#x2018;long peace&#x2019;, which ultimately we owe to that bureacucracy.</p>","<p>With an hour or two left before we had to leave town for our late afternoon flight, we caught the metro back to the centre, strolling one last time through the crowds in the Grand Place. In the touristy Rue des Bouchers we had the staple tourist fodder of <em>moules-frites</em> in a place called Chez Leon, served by a gruff old-timer with walrus whiskers. I&#x2019;d been meaning for us all to have some traditional Belgian fare at some stage this weekend, and this place delivered. <em>Moules-frites</em> is just mussels and chips, but the mussels come in a bucket and Belgian chips are nearly as good as Greek ones. A great meal, hard to get wrong, especially when consumed with a <em>Bi&#xE8;re Chez Leon</em>.</p>","<p>At the airport I reflected on the weekend: both Tina and I had had to take a day off (she was doing a full-time web design course by that stage), and the kids a half-day, for us all to be able to brave the alerts and come to the Brussels Christmas markets, but, you know, <em>m&#xEA;me pas peur</em> - you can&#x2019;t let the bad guys win. Still it continued though: members of the group that had caused the carnage in Paris a month before our trip attacked Brussels three months after we were there. One bomb went off at the airport and the other exploded on a Metro train down near the European Commission headquarters, near where we walked to get to the Parlamentarium, killing thirty-two people.</p>"]]},{"index":9,"title":"Ballyconneely on the edge","pages":[["<p>Cousin Damo had offered us the use of the holiday home he and his family owned just outside Ballyconneely, on the edge of Roundstone Bog.

I don&#x2019;t miss the three sisters of Leixlip, Lucan, and Maynooth. I&#x2019;d be happy if I never had to drive through Kinnegad again, having to always make sure to turn left at Macari&#x2019;s. The successful transit of a member of the Eurozone should not hinge on not missing the turn at a chipper: it belittles the enterprise, however excellent the fare was in that establishment. And don&#x2019;t talk to me about the narrows of Athlone, the treacherous roundabouts of Galway, or the long empty stretches at Mervue and Terryland with their universally unobserved 30km/h speed limits.</p>","<p>On the far side of Galway we stopped for a coke and a stretch of the legs at the Westwood, all cosy and dolled up with Christmas decorations, before hitting the road west, into the twilight and the rain. The Westwood is where the hitchers bound for Connemara would stand when there were hitchers - where I stood too on occasion in the old days - in the pre-modern era when not everyone had a car or access to one. By the time we got to Ballyconneely it was pitch-black and the hedges and holiday homes were being slapped about by gale force winds coming off Mannin and Errislannan. The rain was only fierce. Under those circumstances, finding a house in the dark that we&#x2019;d never been to, solely on the basis that it was &#x201C;the ninth one after Keogh&#x2019;s on the golf course road&#x201D;, seemed unlikely, but we found it, because we had to. If we hadn&#x2019;t we&#x2019;d have been blown to Newfoundland. We fell asleep listening to the banshee whistle blowing through the house.</p>","<p>As is so often the case after a tempest, the calm that followed seemed miraculous. It was all worth it just to be in Keogh&#x2019;s the week before Christmas with pints and toasted cheese sandwiches, listening to <em>Fairytale of New York</em> after a walk out to Bunowen castle, past the ruins of the seaweed factory, all the way to the foot of Doon hill. To see the boys catch up with their cousins from the opposite sides of the planet. This was the very edge of the continent, the westermost point we&#x2019;d get to on this trip. My Dad came from Connemara. This would be a suitable place to pass on family lore and knowledge to Alexander and Eoin, like how to hold in the metal coin rack on the pool table so that <em>all</em> the balls come out. Stuff like that.</p>"],["<p>Christmas in Queensland is just a terrible idea. That&#x2019;s around about when the humidity arrives with full subtropical force. We&#x2019;ve spent Christmas days by the pool or in the room with the aircon in whichever relative&#x2019;s house we have to spend the day. It&#x2019;s the polar opposite of cosy, which is how Christmas is supposed to be. Moreover, instead of congregating in front of a fire in some pub with friends returned from all over the world, people in Queensland disperse to Yamba or Mooloolaba for Christmas. And in possibly the most egregious breach of etiquette, there are kangaroos instead of reindeer in the department store window displays. Here in Dublin, on the other hand, things are colder and cosier at Christmas, reindeer reign supreme, and there&#x2019;s always the remote possibility of snow. That didn&#x2019;t happen this year for us, at least not over Christmas. After our <em>Schneeschuhewandern</em> smorgasbord of the white stuff on M&#xFC;rzzuschlag, we didn&#x2019;t mind too much.</p>","<p>With about ten or so days of work left before the holidays things were already beginning to wind down at work. One sensed about the office, thinning out by the day, a general air of yuletide slackness, and even, despite the generally sterile ambiance of a fintech office, festivity. Even though I was just a contractor, the heads in TruePay were decent enough to include me in the company ice skating excursion at Ballsbridge one evening. It was the first time I&#x2019;d ever ice skated ever, and as I went around and around with my friends, finding my - so-to-speak - sea legs, I recalled that morning full of promise, the first day of our trip all those months ago in Vienna, when Tina and I had watched Alexander and Eoin skate, for the first time too, at the Rathaus. A couple of afternoons later a dozen or so of us clocked off and had a company-sponsored bubbleball session at a nearby sports centre. Bubbleball, or bubble soccer, is like ordinary indoor soccer, except for one detail: one has a huge, transparent plastic/rubber bubble thing over one&#x2019;s upper body and head that turns one into a walking lollipop, leaving only the legs free. The whereabouts of the ball becomes sendary to the actual point of the &#x2018;game&#x2019;, which seems to be to run around and collide with the other lollipops. I found it truly nervewracking. At one stage, one of the database administrators hit me so hard I ended up upside down, like Kafka&#x2019;s Gregor Samsa, whose legs &#x201C;pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes.&#x201D;</p>","<p>As we&#x2019;d hoped, things just got cosier and cosier the closer we got to the big day itself. At the TruePay Christmas party, I went along for the pre-meal drinks at the fancy Clayton Hotel but decided to skip the meal itself to catch the train to <em>Ceoiltas</em> where Tina was in the middle of her concertina lesson and the boys in their rooms. A bit too blemished with the drink to handle M&#xE1;ire&#x2019;s socialist musings <em>as Gaeilge</em>, I drank with one of Mum&#x2019;s neighbours, Mike, a <em>Ceoiltas </em>regular whose own kids were learning the tin whistle, down in the bar till the gang all came down. All as cosy as a teapot hanging over the hearth of a fiWith with a framed picture of JFK or the Pope on the mantelpiece.</p>","<p>Like a deserted famine village on the slopes of Achill Island, the round fort-shaped open meeting spaces, twelve or so feet across apiece, semi-circular in shape, with privacy-giving walls on one side about 2 metres high that sloped down rapidly. Were all empty of their usual denizens. You had to marvel at the breezy sadism of giving meeting areas names the likes of Caherconnell, Killaspuglonane, and, best of all, Caher Dhuin Uirguis, in an office peppered with francophones, spanish-speakers, and an extremely short-sighted Java dev from Szczecin called Jacek. &#x201C;Those yokes are named after actual ringforts in Clare,&#x201D; Conor had told me.</p>","<p>It was Christmas Eve already. Tradition, at least in Ireland, dictates that you watch a Dutchman with a mullet playing Mexican folk songs on a violin to a hall full of pissed Germans on the telly. It&#x2019;s usually best not to question tradition; the bizarrer, the better not to question. We also watched the British astronaut Tim Peake arrive at the space station. And having explained to Mum that we hadn&#x2019;t come all this way to gather around a foldable plastic tree, we put up the real tree we&#x2019;d bought for a tenner. We&#x2019;d all have just have to live with the fact that, yes, real trees shed needles, but we&#x2019;d hoover the place afterwards, don;t worry. Honestly.</p>"]]},{"index":10,"title":"Convento de Cristo, Tomar","pages":[["<p>In Tomar, exactly halfway up and across Portugal, Casaubon&#x2019;s mind was blown. The hero of Umberto Eco&#x2019;s book <em>Foucault&#x2019;s Pendulum</em>, Casaubon is a publisher with an interest in medieval European history, especially where it comes to conspiracies involving fortunes in gold stashed away (allegedly) in churches in the south of France by shadowy medieval cabals that survive (according to some, but not Casaubon himself - at least not until he comes to Tomar) to this day.</p>","<p>He was there to see the Convento de Cristo, the Convent of the Knights of Christ, a fortress built for the Templars some eight hundred and fifty years ago. As Eco has it, the amateur occultist&#x2019;s long-held skepticism about the group&#x2019;s continued existence comes face to face with the walls, ramparts and buttresses he beholds before him. The castle is evidence, if you have the eyes to see it, not just of the Knights&#x2019; original militaristic purpose but also, amazingly, their continued existence. Long skeptical about the idea that somehow the Templars had lived on after the dawn raids on that Friday the 13th, 1307, and the subsequent auto-da-f&#xE9;s, at the Convento de Cristo Casaubon convinces himself that they had. The conspiracies are real!</p>","<p>In the standard explanation, after being officially dissolved in 1312 by Philip the Fair, King of France, the surviving members of the Templars scattered to the corners of Europe. Tomar is one of those corners. In Portugal, they took a more live and let live attitude towards the Knights that had become too big for their <em>sabotons</em> than they did in France. King Dinis had gotten around the edict to suppress The Order of the Temple by pouring the old wine into a new bottle, which he called The Order of Christ. The new Order set up its headquarters in the Algarve, relocating to Tomar in 1357. Not only was the Order allowed to flourish in Portugal, it soon became synonymous with the monarchy. Under Enrique el Navegador - Henry the Navigator &#x2013; it embarked on voyages of discovery and conquest of Asia.</p>","<p>On a cold morning a couple of days after Christmas I sat in a corner of Europe at one of the outside tables of a caf&#xE9; on Pra&#xE7;a de Rep&#xFA;blica, the main square in Tomar, watching the occasional passerby scatter the pigeons as they walked. I&#x2019;d spent my share of the breakfast budget on a macchiato. Not up to the cold, Tina and the boys went off to a warm bakery to get themselves some <em>past&#xE9;is de nata</em>, the pastry tarts with custard and cinnamon we&#x2019;d been loving since we arrived in Portugal. In the centre of the square was a statue of Gualdim Pais, the founder of Tomar and an early leader of the Order of Christ. The square itself was a bold, skewed checkerboard pattern of black and white diamonds, each one about a metre long and packed with pebbles. Did any of the people who were walking around me, whistling as they clicked along the diamonds, getting their morning bread, having a fortifying walk in the early morning cold - did they secretly harbour Rosicruscian or neo-Templar affinities? Maybe the waitress who brought me my bill did. Maybe the woman walking a child through the square did. Behind me, up the hill, was the Convento de Cristo. Come on kids, come on Tina, I want to get up there.</p>","<p>Over a succession of Monday evenings in November Tina and I had watched an Open University mini-series on TV about the history of the Iberian peninsula, and it began to occur to us that it would be splendid to actually go to Spain, or Portugal, or both, in the post-Christmas doldrums. Neither of us had ever been to Portugal before. So neither of us dared back down from the idea once it took hold. I thought she would and she thought I would and then one of us organised the whole bloody thing and that was that. Such brinksmanship and pecuniary fecklessness landed us early one morning two days after Christmas in Lisbon airport for the start of a ten-day driving trip.</p>","<p>Our time in any one place would be too short to allow for any sort of work exchange, not that we felt remotely like doing that over Christmas and New Year&#x2019;s. Also, the busy festive period meant that few had been giving away &#x2018;couches&#x2019; (in fact, we&#x2019;d only managed to get one). The tricks we&#x2019;d learned on the road during the summer had been seasonal, it seemed.</p>","<p>Our initial impressions of Portugal for the first couple of days were azulejo-coloured and cork-textured. Sintra, just west of Lisbon, left me with a port hangover in the depths of which I swore off the stuff, at least for this trip. Successfully, I might add. There&#x2019;d been fantasy red-and-yellow castles on hills those first days, places which owed more to the imaginations of nineteenth-century aristocrats than to the reality of medieval history; spiralling wells down which we walked to reach labyrinth caves; and a rainy coastal town where we ate bacalhao in a place called Tasquinha do Joy. In every place we stopped, Alexander and Eoin hit the souvenir shops to see what Knights of Christ figurines, vivid in their white robes and red crosses, they could stock up on.</p>","<p>The sun struggled to make much of an impression on the sky as we walked up the slope early that morning to the Convento de Cristo, leaving behind and below us the diamonds of Pra&#xE7;a de Rep&#xFA;blica. We&#x2019;d primed Alexander and Eoin, warmed up with past&#xE9;is, with Templars&#x2019; lore, and prayed there&#x2019;d be figurines in the gift shop. Entering the Convento, you go straight into the Charola, a rotunda based on the Holy of Holies. In the 12th and 13th centuries, romanesque and gothic religious architecture tended to take inspiration from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which was round. It doesn&#x2019;t look up to much from the outside but the Charola was easily the most impressive part of the whole complex. Being in this multi-coloured oddity was like switching on a colour TV tuned to the early middle ages. We walked around the inner &#x2018;drum&#x2019;, open-mouthed in this riot of colours, gazing up at the two- and three-metre-long panels depicting scenes from the life of Christ, never having imagined from down on the square a heart so vivid to be beating in the bosom of such a foreboding castle.</p>","<p>Ever since seeing my first pendulum back in Frombork with Adam and the gang a couple of months earlier, I&#x2019;d become interested in reading <em>Foucault&#x2019;s Pendulum</em>. I hadn&#x2019;t read it at that stage but the idea of a book that sweeps large chunks of European history into a bag and shakes it all about of course appealed to me, since it sounded like the literary equivalent of what we were trying to achieve with this trip. Walking around the convent&#x2019;s cloisters I felt like Causabon must have - the walls, yellowed with lichen, upon which you might see angels carrying armillary spheres, were like the pages of books written in a language only the ignorant call dead. It perplexed Casaubon that the Knights of Malta&#x2019;s crosses had remained the same through the years yet the crosses here, the Templars&#x2019;, were subject to local whims and fancies. Blown away by the evidence, he left Tomar &#x201C;<em>con la mente in fiamme</em>&#x201D;, his head a jumble of Templars and Stonehenges, Avalons, and Agartthas, unable to stop himself freewheeling out of control through history, seeing conspiracies everywhere. He was now convinced that the Knights had had <em>un piano</em> (plan) all along which they&#x2019;d managed to carry out over the span of seven hundred years, passing on the arcane knowledge required for their survival like parents passing on their DNA to their children. You have to go into a place like Tomar feeling somewhat like old Casaubon.</p>","<p>There were no figurines in the end, but Alexander and Eoin did buy Templar-themed travel journals. Even though they had their Kindle Fire devices to read ebooks on, we wanted them writing, actually writing, holding a pen or pencil with their fingers, on paper, to form words, or even drawings and maps. Doodles would be tolerated.</p>"],["<p>We were quite excited about meeting our couchsurfing host. We&#x2019;d chat, maybe have a <em>pastel de nata</em> or two, and get to the bottom of the issues of the day: what do the Portuguese think about Europe? About living in a country where drugs, all drugs, have been decriminalised since 2001? About their flamboyant neighbours, the Spanish, and about the Spanish language, which we&#x2019;d found they were reluctant to speak, although surely, surely, it had to be easier for them to do so than English, which they seemed to prefer from the little we&#x2019;d seen and heard so far. In the event of one not speaking Portuguese, of course. Neither Tina or I, or the boys for that matter, could speak a word of Portuguese except &#x2018;<em>obrigado</em>&#x2019;. This was another Poland for us. Another Hungary. It was all getting a bit embarrassing. We were becoming the ugly Australians. I&#x2019;d been rather hoping my Spanish would do us here in Portugal. (This was my strategy for Italy as well for the coming summer. All being well, we&#x2019;d leave Ireland once the kids finished school at the end of June, find some work exchanges in France or Italy, and make our way slowly to Zakynthos.) Despite any evidence, I fully expected Spanish to be a universal Latin esperanto that would bring peoples of widely different cultures together in a big smiling, back-slapping fiesta of <em>di&#xE1;logo</em> and <em>conversaci&#xF3;n</em>. Piotr had understood that. Why couldn&#x2019;t the Portuguese? Laura (for that was our host&#x2019;s name) would answer all these questions for us.</p>","<p>Once in the door of her apartment, on the edge of the town of Mafra, we found that we&#x2019;d struck lucky with our &#x2018;couch&#x2019; once again - two rooms between the four of us. Nice rooms, mind. And Laura seemed happy to spend the evening with us. Glamorously, she was an air stewardess for TAP, Portugal&#x2019;s national airline. It was about time our trip had a splash of glamour. She was in her thirties, I&#x2019;d say, and had short brown hair. Strangely, she had a London accent. It turned out she was tired after an overnighter from Brazil, but would stay up with us to get back to normal time. Bravo!</p>","<p>What was it like to be an air stewardess, we wondered? It would be interesting getting the perspective from the cabin staff for once. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Laura was somewhat scathing about her passengers.</p>","<p>&#x201C;They never try to solve their problems with each other before calling us over. They ring the bell for assistance and when you go over to them they say, &#x2018;Can you tell the person behind me to stop this or that&#x2019;, without talking to the person themselves. They&#x2019;re like children. They expect us to solve their problems like we&#x2019;re their mother!&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I suppose as an air stewardess you must get to travel a lot?&#x201D; I asked, with piercing insight.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Of course. This year I went to Peru. Want to see some pictures?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Sure.&#x201D;</p>","<p>What I meant to say was: &#x201C;Of Peru? Well, we were hoping to find out more about Portugal&#x2026;&#x201D; But by then she&#x2019;d taken out her iPad, fired up the photos app, plonked it down in front of me, and off we all went, me driving, on a virtual tour of Inca ruins, villages, lakes, shops, towns and cities. There were pictures of her and her friend in laneways, outside cathedrals, on bikes, and on mountaintops. As each photo of a dry, sunblasted town square or cathedral lit up the screen in the dim light of her front room (I considered getting my shades from the car) she would annotate the picture for a minute or two, unless it was an almost exact copy of its predecessor (which was the case surprisingly often, taken just a split-second later, or from just a bit to the left.) Tina or I would politely enquire about some aspect of the scene, she&#x2019;d elaborate, and I&#x2019;d right-arrow to the next one. Breaking out of the moment to ask her anything about Portugal, like: what&#x2019;s up with Ronaldo and his taxes?, in the middle of an explanation of how Peruvian women wear their hats at weddings would just have been poor form, I thought, so I kept clicking.</p>","<p>And that was how we spent our evening in Mafra. There were four hundred and ninety photos. I know that number because I kept an eye on the counter in the corner of the screen, which showed the index of the current photograph within the folder, and when I noticed a) the large quantity of photos remaining and b) the failure to show any inclination to call an end to the viewing on Laura&#x2019;s behalf, I thought: there&#x2019;s no way we&#x2019;re going past five hundred. Mind you, I&#x2019;d thought the same when we crossed the triple figure threshold a long time ago, when the kids were still up. I&#x2019;d like to go to Peru, one day. So would Tina. At this stage, however, I don&#x2019;t think we need to, to be honest, since there&#x2019;d be very little left for us to explore.</p>","<p>But we did get to sate our <em>past&#xE9;is de nata</em> habit the next morning in a caf&#xE9; in town. The weather had improved, and sitting there in the sunshine on Mafra&#x2019;s main square with the one person from this country who&#x2019;d been good enough to host us and spend time with us, we scanned the buildings and streets of Mafra and rejoiced at its utter lack of Inca ruins.</p>","<p>On a long road under a sky shared by both Portugal and Spain we crossed the strange non-border that exists nowadays between EU members, stopping in Caceres for the night, then transiting Merida, where the spectacular (at least what we could see through the fence) Roman ruins were closed for New Year&#x2019;s Eve. We were in Andaluc&#xED;a, the only European region with both Mediterranean and Atlantic coastlines, apparently, by mid-afternoon, and reached Seville by late afternoon. After barely managing to park our car in the narrow streets of Triana, the Airbnb-heavy left-bank quarter, we managed to park our behinds on a couple of crates in the first tiny bodega we could find, where we talked about how great foreign travel was with a couple of Canadian women. For the next couple of days we were going to struggle to meet anyone in this once-upon-a-time Arab city who wasn&#x2019;t like us: Airbnbers from the cold north, here for the tapas and the gypsy dancing. The problem became acute in places like <em>La Casa Del Flamenco</em>, a fifteenth-century <em>cas&#xF3;n</em> in the narrow streets of the Santa Cruz barrio where we saw a show that first night with a potpourri of French and German tourists. &#x201C;<em>Bof! Les Fran&#xE7;ais partout!</em>&#x201D; I heard a woman behind me say. But we set aside our worries and let the music bring us back to the strange Moorish city Seville must once have been. Not since a gamelan performance in Bali had I heard music so maddening. On an Indonesian island one expects to hear indecipherable melodies and rhythms, but not here in Europe. My inner metronome couldn&#x2019;t make any sense of it. Only the electrifying synchronicity of the sudden crescendos of the sole <em>guitarrista</em> with the dancers&#x2019; boot stamps and fluffed-up and pouting dead stops convinced me that they weren&#x2019;t just making it all up on the spot. After a pause they&#x2019;d start again, and with them my musical befuddlement, and I&#x2019;d convince myself anew that they were just winging it.</p>","<p>For the remainder of the evening we did what one does here, without particularly meaning to, or even knowing there was a word for it: <em>tapeo</em>. We walked around the alleyways behind the Alcazar stopping into bars and <em>bodeguitas</em> for a plate of olives or some manchego and a cerveza, saying things like &#x201C;<em>Espinacas con garbanzos, por favor. Si, una cervezita tambien,</em>&#x201D; rubbing shoulders with the Sevillanos or, more likely, the Americans and Germans, moving on again after a half an hour or so. The glistening cobblestones and their puddles were beginning to reflect the evening lights in the light rain as we dodged orange trees and chalkboards on the pavements, looking into and occasionally entering the tiny bars with their silver tinsel still draped over the giant hams hanging from the ceilings and walls.</p>","<p>We happily abandoned ourselves to tourist traps and confidently ordered <em>raciones</em>, the big brother of tapas, of <em>jam&#xF3;n iberico</em> and <em>taquitos de bacalhao</em>, fully aware of our lack of credibility and loving it. The sweet cigarette smoke of the <em>fumadores</em> drifted in off the <em>avenida</em>. The euphoria of a good hunger quenched gave me the confidence to talk to the people around me, who inevitably turned out to be more Canadians staying in an Airbnb near us. What can you do? It&#x2019;s <em>Nochevieja</em> (New Year&#x2019;s Eve) in Seville.</p>","<p>Ehilarating and exhausting as it all was, we&#x2019;d been feeling buffeted by the crowds. There was no way Alexander and Eoin were going to last till midnight, and neither were we. Orange trees lined the avenidas and callejones on our way home with their fruit wastefully spilt in the wet gutters alongside the large maple-like leaves all green, red, and brown that were still falling prettily at this time of the year. I&#x2019;d go a cone of chestnuts from the filthy-fingered <em>vendedor</em> near the tobacco factory from the opera <em>Carmen</em>, I thought, then did it, but said to myself that that&#x2019;s definitely, positively the last thing I&#x2019;m eating tonight<em>. </em>I found an intact orange and cleaned it in the Cathedral fountain to take home. Tina scoffed. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re bitter. They&#x2019;re not ordinary oranges. That&#x2019;s why people don&#x2019;t pick them off the trees.&#x201D; Why did she want to ruin my Seville moment? A bitter orange? How could you tell from just looking at it? I shall peel it and savour it. (This I did, a day later, at lunch back in the apartment. Well, I peeled it, but it tasted disgusting, and it hit the bin with great force. Never knew there were bitter oranges. Now I knew.) Crossing the last bridge back into Triana we bought two coffees from a <em>churros quiosco</em> and I sent Eoin back over the bridge with one of them to give to the homeless guy we&#x2019;d passed sitting there in the drizzle, hoping he didn&#x2019;t take sugar.</p>","<p>For the first time in about five years, Tina and I stayed up till midnight together. We found some live New Year&#x2019;s comedy extravaganza on TV just to get in the spirit and sat in the dark drinking cava with the TV turned down and the lights turned off for the benefit of Alexander and Eoin who were on their bunk bed right there alongside us in the front room of our ground-floor <em>apartamento</em>. Actually, it was more an <em>apartamentito</em>, but I&#x2019;m not sure that&#x2019;s a word.</p>","<p>What a year we&#x2019;d had! We&#x2019;d learned new ways of getting around and seeing things. The sights we&#x2019;d seen, the friends we&#x2019;d made - they were all there with us in that <em>apartamentito (</em>fuck it: I&#x2019;m using it.<em>)</em> When the fireworks came, they sounded like they were right outside the building, but we guessed they were on the <em>plazuela</em> nearby, the small square at the church not one hundred yards away. Seville, New Year&#x2019;s Eve - not bad going. As I fell asleep, my last thought of 2015, this year of years, was: if you thought ordinary Spanish people talk fast, you haven&#x2019;t heard their stand-up comedians.</p>"],["<p>One thousand years ago there were only four cities in Europe with over fifty thousand inhabitants: Constantinople, Palermo, Seville and C&#xF3;rdoba. As well as staying in one of them, there was another only an hour down the road, on the same river, the Guadalquivir. We found a nice torture museum not one hundred metres into the old walled quarter of C&#xF3;rdoba. They say tragedy plus time equals comedy. A lot of time would have to pass to make a museum about the instruments used during the Spanish Inquisition funny, but one&#x2019;s squeamishness about these things is inevitably mitigated by the fog of time. Well, mine, Alexander&#x2019;s and Eoin&#x2019;s was: Tina huffed off in disgust and went shopping. Which was funny, because of course, as men, we considered that to be the real torture.</p>","<p>They&#x2019;d managed to make the museum, with its iron maidens and head screws, into, well, if not a light-hearted place, then at least not an excessively sombre one. It was still a place in which one was forced to face one&#x2019;s true humanity, or at least Spanish religious fanatics of the sixteenth century&#x2019;s true humanity. But the clear-skinned nubility and buxomity of the victims in the tawdry sketches accompanying some of the exhibits distanced one from the awful nature of it all. The sketches were even titillating. By the time we got to &#x201C;the pear&#x201D; I was convinced the owners were just messing with us all. &#xBF;Horrified, <em>se&#xF1;or</em>? <em>Si, si</em>. Aroused, too? <em>&#xBF;Poquito?</em></p>","<p>&#x201C;Come on boys, it&#x2019;s time to leave.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;That was cool.&#x201D;</p>","<p>We rounded Tina up and made for the Mezquita. Now, when Tina goes away she researches a trip thoroughly. It&#x2019;s a trait I greatly admire. I&#x2019;ll often walk into our front room at home, whether in the suburbs of Brisbane or in Dublin, to find her poring over a guide to whatever place we&#x2019;re off to next.</p>","<p>&#x201C;What are you reading?&#x201D; I&#x2019;ll ask.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh, just finding places we can think about visiting when we go to Provence in the summer.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to Provence in the summer?&#x201D; That sort of thing.</p>","<p>Being in IT, I, on the other hand, tend to outsource things. I&#x2019;d left the researching of C&#xF3;rdoba, for example, to Tina. It&#x2019;s all very selfish of me and there&#x2019;s a fair amount of self-loathing involved, don&#x2019;t worry. I knew one of the main reasons for today&#x2019;s trip was to see the world-famous Moorish wonder called the Mezquita - I even knew that that word is Spanish for &#x2018;mosque&#x2019;. We&#x2019;d seen it in that Open University programme about Spain, the one that prompted us to come here in the first place. You&#x2019;d really have to have lived in a cave never to have seen pictures of that dark labyrinth of hundreds of terracotta-coloured, two-tone arches on five-metre or so high marble pillars. So that much I knew. But the advantage in not researching things is that life regularly throws me surprises, like it did there in the Mezquita, turning a corner, I found myself, to my great consternation, in a huge Christian cathedral by all appearances. I couldn&#x2019;t make sense of it, and sought the assurances of someone who had done their research.</p>","<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a Catholic cathedral in the middle of all this?&#x201D; I said to Tina, staring up at the arched roof.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Indeed,&#x201D; she replied, shockingly blas&#xE9; and astonishingly unphased.</p>","<p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s a cathedral doing in the middle of this?&#x201D; I asked, shaking my head. &#x201C;I thought it was a Muslim building.&#x201D;</p>","<p>How many of the other people here had known about the cathedral that just grew out of the Mezquita like a mushroom out of the forest floor? Probably everyone. Not having had a clue about any of this only to stumble upon it like I&#x2019;d done felt nice, and there and then I vowed to read as little as I could get away with about the places we&#x2019;d be visiting in the future.</p>","<p>Back in Seville, we felt we could achieve a sort of localness by illegally leaving the boys in the <em>apartmentito</em> and going out for a quick glass of Cruzcampo at the Taberna la Plazuela, from where we could practically hear them should they scream for some reason. This small square had a few immature plane trees growing within iron casings and faced a terracotta church with a deafening bell-tower. If it wasn&#x2019;t for all the paperwork we&#x2019;d have to do and the boys back in the Airbnb we could have retired on that plazuela.</p>","<p>Leaving Seville early in the morning we crossed back into Portugal under a dismal sky. We stayed in a <em>pousada</em> called Convento &#xC9;vora, one of around forty-five historic buildings throughout the country that had been converted into upmarket guesthouses. Once run by the state, they&#x2019;ve all since been privatised. Evora turned out to be quite interesting: the Roman-era Temple of Diana lay right outside our front door, and it was a thrill to come home at night after a streal around town and see it all lit up. The town is also famous for its ossuary, with a famous quote over the entrance:</p>","<p><em>&gt;N&#xF3;s ossos que aqui estamos pelos vossos esperamos</em></p>","<blockquote>\n<p>(&#x201C;We bones you see in this poor state, for you and yours do sit and wait&quot;)</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>From Evora we drove west across the plain, crossing the Tagus delta on the ten-kilometre-long Ponte Vasco da Gama, to get to Lisbon&#x2019;s atmospheric old quarter of Alfama. The winding steps up to our place had full-wall poster-like murals showing imaginary scenes from Fado sessions (the folk music of Portugal) - all vampy sirens putting it out there and besuited Djangos attending solemnly to their fretwork. Yellow trams busied themselves around the squares as we spent our first evening puddle-hopping and shoe shopping. Travel with children is equal parts visiting World Heritage sites like the Mezquita, and spending your evening in Lisbon walking past interesting restaurants trying to find a budget shoe shop because Alexander has already outgrown the last pair of runners you bought. And while I&#x2019;m at it, one thing they don&#x2019;t mention in the guidebooks is that Lisbon is the worst place to be in the rain, what with its tiled pavements and walkways, which become treacherous, frictionless devils in the wet.</p>","<p>Where we were wasn&#x2019;t far from a conspicuously rectilinear grid of streets between the Pra&#xE7;a da Figueira and the Pra&#xE7;a do Com&#xE9;rcio down by the water, evidence of the post-earthquake reconstruction of the city. Lisbon had very nearly been flattened two hundred and sixty years earlier, but there had once been a time, many years before that, when it could have been said to be the centre of the world, or at least the point of departure for explorations all around the world. When the rain finally stopped we took a bus one morning along the Bel&#xE9;m sea-front, all the way to the massive concrete Monument to the Discoveries, the sail-shaped backdrop to Henry the Navigator&#x2019;s thrusting pose out into the world. Our figure-of-eight tour through the waistline of Portugal, into southern Spain, and back into Portugal again over a period in which the weather had swung back and forth like a pendulum had given us a taste for finding out more about the Age of Exploration, and intrigued us with the small hints of Templar conspiracies we&#x2019;d learn more about, hopefully, in France next year. And we&#x2019;d missed a storm called Frank at home.</p>"]]},{"index":11,"title":"The trouble spots of Belfast","pages":[["<p>After all the continental comings and goings we kept our powder dry for the rest of January and all of February. A combination of iron-willed restraint and being flat broke meant that by March there were no foreign excursions on the horizon. Alexander and Eoin manfully stuck out a sailing course down in Dun Laoghaire over a week of bitterly cold mornings that left Al crying in the evenings from the chilblains. I gave up cycling to work &#x2013; the cold, the rain, and the morning and evening darkness meant that it just wasn&#x2019;t worth it. The Dart to work was always packed but at least I could play chess on my phone, and the walk from Google Docks to my office, through Grand Canal Square, along Misery Hill, past the Bord G&#xE1;is Energy Theatre and the Facebook headquarters, made me feel like I was right in the heart of things. With a flat white in my hand, I&#x2019;d breathe in the cold dock air and if the light was good, which it was surprisingingly often, I&#x2019;d stop and take a photo from the bridge approaching the square, grateful to be working in the Docklands.</p>","<p>On my lunch break I&#x2019;d often take a Coke Zero Dublin Bike to Il Valentino on the corner of Grand Canal Square and Pearse Street. They did a mean chicken and sundried tomato panini for a fiver. On the elevated outside deck I&#x2019;d read the deli&#x2019;s Irish Independent, the pages fluttering in my hand like a flag in the breeze. Boland&#x2019;s Flour Mill and the iconic new checkboard-pattern Marker Hotel squared off over the glassy waters of the canal. Often there&#x2019;d be a Dublin Bike guy taking bikes from the docking area right outside Il Valentino, and putting them onto the back of his truck to distribute them to stations that needed them. Straight ahead of me Mahon bridge led along Pearse St. towards Shelbourne Park. A woman was shot right on the bridge there during the Easter Rising, according to a plaque mid-span.</p>","<p>Other than work colleagues I didn&#x2019;t really know anyone in Dublin. From time to time I&#x2019;d saddle up and take a Coke Zero to another Italian deli/caf&#xE9; called Il Caff&#xE8; Di Napoli to meet Cousin Damo. God gives you cousins, but you have to make your own friends in this life. Those that I had when I lived in Dublin now lived in New York, Brisbane, Vancouver, or Ballywaltrim, which is just outside Bray. In TruePay I was on a project that involved few other people - in fact none, if you didn&#x2019;t count Conor, my boss. My project never generated meetings other than the monthly progress reports I had with Conor, and as time passed he gave less and less of a hoot about what I was working on, which was nice since it meant less pressure, but it also meant I had no real reason to work with the one person I had to work with. &#x201C;I came to Europe to meet people!&#x201D; I felt like telling him. I was going to have to adopt the Couchsurfing philosophy - if you can&#x2019;t travel, you can at least bring the travel to you. I was going to have to walk up to strangers and demand they pay attention to me.</p>","<p>Since starting at TruePay, Spanish words had been buzzing around my ears like mosquitos. Musical &#x2018;&#x2026;<em>ando&#x2019;</em>s and sweet &#x2018;&#x2026;<em>miento&#x2019;</em>s, terracotta-flavoured sounds of the Andalucian landscape, intrigued me. I found out it was because TruePay had partnerships with Banco Santander and Caixa, a couple of big Spanish banks, and so needed a steady supply of Spanish speakers. A guy a few rows behind me seemed to spend most of his time reading out passwords to new sign-ups.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Erre - mayusculo, ocho, effay &#x2013; no, minusculo &#x2013; tres, bay, cinco, &#x2026;</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>I took notes on the Spaniards who stood smoking outside the front door as I&#x2019;d come back from the Eurospar with a Crunchie to get me through the next hour, or as they played pool in Mrs Doyle&#x2019;s (that&#x2019;s right, the kitchen area of the office was named after Father Ted&#x2019;s long-suffering tea lady.) I observed and lurked, like David Attenborough, noting the alpha males, and the stragglers I could pick off. Finally, one lunchtime, judging the moment propitious, I took my leftover spaghetti and eased into a spare chair at a table where a <em>congreso</em> of three Spanish-speakers were chatting away over microwaved chicken curries.</p>","<p>&#x201C;So, where are you guys from?&#x201D; I asked the general assembly, desperately hoping one of them a) would answer, and b) that I&#x2019;d know something about where he was from.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Malaga,&#x201D;one of them answered.</p>","<p><em>Mierda!</em> Despite spending a night there once, I knew nothing about it other than that it was near Granada, a much nicer town. Couldn&#x2019;t say that. Wait! I knew a phrase about Malaga.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ahem: &#x2018;<em>irse de Malaga para meterse en Malag&#xF3;n</em>,&#x201D; I declared. That meant, as far as I was aware, to get out of Malaga only to end up in Malag&#xF3;n, wherever that is. Somewhere worse, clearly, since the phrase roughly corresponds to &#x2018;out of the frying pan and into the fire&#x2019;, playing as it does on the &#x2018;mala&#x2019;, meaning &#x2018;bad&#x2019;, part of the towns&#x2019; names. Zing! My work on Memrise.com had paid off. My brain high-fived itself.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>&#xBF;Como?</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>Oh come on, I made a good fist of that! Looking around for support, all I got were blanks. I repeated the phrase, over-rolling my &#x2018;r&#x2019;s, clipping my consonants and generally sounding as much like Julio Iglesias as I could. The suaveness of my voice was overwhelming. Women fainted. <em>Silencio</em> from the men, however. Then one of them finally cottoned on: &#x201C;<em>&#xA1;</em><em>Ah! Si.</em> But in Argentina we say &#x2018;Guatamala&#x2019; and &#x2018;Guatepeor&#x2019; instead.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh, like &#x2018;<em>irse de Guatamala para meterse en Guatepeor</em>&#x2019;?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Si.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>And then, <em>then</em>, the guy from Malaga got it. &#x201C;<em>&#xA1;</em><em>Ah!</em>&#x201D; He chuckled.</p>","<p>Oh fuck me, he&#x2019;d heard of that one but hadn&#x2019;t heard the version with Malaga? &#x201C;How can you not have heard of the version with Malaga? You&#x2019;re from Malaga!&#x201D; I shouted at him.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>S&#xED;, s&#xED;,</em>&#x201D; he said, shrugging and looking embarrassed. It turns out in Spain they also have those people who go red in the face when they&#x2019;re the centre of attention even though they hadn&#x2019;t done anything wrong. I thought that was just me. This wasn&#x2019;t going well. But I worked my Spanish chops furiously for the next couple of minutes, regaining the ground I&#x2019;d lost, and next thing I knew I was spending lunchtimes chatting with Manuel from Malaga, Esteban from Argentina, Juan from Murcia, and Jacek from Szceczin who had no other Poles to hang around with.</p>"],["<p>This year&#x2019;s St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day Parade was our first parade here in Dublin. Of course, having grown up here, I&#x2019;ve been to my fair share of Dublin parades, but not for twenty years or so. They throw a decent enough parade in Brisbane and we&#x2019;ve been to a few of those over the years, though as an aside I feared (and was right to) that the Irish Club on Elizabeth St. wouldn&#x2019;t be there when we got back. Going to the Dublin parade had long been on our agenda, and we weren&#x2019;t going to miss it come rain or shine. Came shine, mercifully, and on the Thursday morning that was in it we drove into town and parked in a street of unsalubrious aspect between Mountjoy Square and North Circular Road.</p>","<p>When I was a kid the parade was just a parade and it started at Merrion Square. In keeping with the times we live in in which everything has to be a three-day festival, nowadays the parade itself is just the event that starts off a whole three-day festival. The parade goes from up near the Garden of Remembrance on Parnell Square, down O&#x2019;Connell St., wraps around College Green, heads out west along Dame Street, before finally turning south down Patrick St. and ending at St. Patrick&#x2019;s Cathedral, appropriately enough.</p>","<p>Walking downhill from Mountjoy Square we turned at Gardiner Street and headed for the Parnell obelisk at the top of O&#x2019;Connell Street along a stretch of Parnell Street I&#x2019;ve heard called Dublin&#x2019;s Chinatown. All life was out on the street there, some dressed as leprechauns, many speaking Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese.</p>","<p>We&#x2019;d left it a bit late.Well of course we had: we had kids and lived in the outer suburbs. We took a hill and held it opposite the Gate Theatre, outside a hotel called Cassidy&#x2019;s on the Georgian strip called Cavendish Row, better known as &#x2018;the bit of Parnell Square near Cassidy&#x2019;s opposite the Gate Theatre&#x2019;. The parade was about to start and Alexander, and especially Eoin, wouldn&#x2019;t be seeing much. Canny operators around us stood on stepladders and children sat on their father&#x2019;s shoulders. Eoin&#x2019;s a bit too old for that now, and I&#x2019;m a bit too old for that now, so Tina got them up on the railings away from the hordes of tall Americans whose leprechaun hats prevented anyone in their vicinity from seeing anything.</p>","<p>As far the parade itself - ah, sure it&#x2019;s always pretty much the same old show as far as I&#x2019;m concerned. Some nice samba music. Some nice dancing. Giant Macnas heads symbolising young people or Ireland&#x2019;s future or Mn&#xE1; na hEireann or the internet or something. At one stage I stood next to a Nigerian guy who seemed to know everyone. He&#x2019;s size people up as they squeezed by us, and if they weren&#x2019;t festooned in paddywhackery, like a shamrock-ringed hat or a &#x2018;Kiss me for Luck&#x2019; tie, like he himself was, he would sternly demand: &#x201C;Where&#x2019;s your green, man?&#x201D; This was his fourteenth parade and he was having the crack.</p>","<p>&#x201C;What happens after the parade?&#x201D; I asked.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Madigan&#x2019;s.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Time was, I treated St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day the same way everyone else did, and probably still does: an excuse to spend the rest of the day in the pub. Those times are long gone, and I was always crap at them anyway. Nowadays I&#x2019;d just be completely out of my depth being in Madigan&#x2019;s at lunchtime. I&#x2019;d just be taking the place of a real drinker. And anyway, after an hour and a half of standing there on Parnell corner, watching the interminable procession of high-concept stuff, it was time to go.</p>","<p>Crowds lined the North Circular Road, grouped noisily at the Hogan Stand pub especially, as we made for the N1. It was All-Ireland Hurling Championship finals day, which would make it a big day in the city even if there was no parade. Once clear of the streets around Croke Park we were able to clock up some miles.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Kilometres, Dad. Kilometres.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s what Alexander says whenever I drop the m-word.</p>","<p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re just disappointed miles to me, Al. I grew up with miles, and I see the world as a place divided up into mile-long lengths.&#x201D;</p>","<p>By lunchtime we were driving over the good bridge Mary Robinson, straddling the river Boyne between Newgrange and Drogheda, a town I lived in as a child. We were in County Louth, on our way north.</p>"],["<p>I&#x2019;d only ever been to Northern Ireland once before, and hardly even at that. Dad and I drove up to visit Uncle Brian in Donegal in 1986. After a pleasant couple of hours drive through the Meath and Monaghan countryside we came to the border just north of Monaghan town and were unceremoniously commanded by soldiers with English accents (I remember being shocked by that, as if I&#x2019;d expected them to be Irish) to get out of the car and open up the boot. They would found my rucksack, and probably, knowing Dad, some of the socks that permanently littered the interior of his car. Oh, and the John Denver and Paul Simon sheet music that he used to buy. He loved singing in the car. Anyway, the squaddies found nothing in the boot and, having scanned underneath the car for good measure, let us go about our business. Eighteen years after the Good Friday Agreement and thirteen after emigrating to the other side of the world, I actually thought things were still like that in the North; soldiers, barbed wire, machine guns in towers.</p>","<p>With the Mountains of Mourne sweeping coulourfully down to the sea to our east I told Alexander and Eoin to be on the <em>qui vive</em> for camouflaged baddies as we bypassed Dundalk, ready at any minute to pull in at short notice. The coast remained mysteriously clear as we swallowed up the road. I scanned the horizon for danger. There was none. What was going on? And then: a signpost on our left which gave its distances in miles, not kilometres. A sign that said so little and so much. The checkpoints were no more. I drove on, relieved, and slightly disappointed.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Lads, you&#x2019;re in a new country. Well, kind of. No, definitely. Welcome to Northern Ireland.&#x201D; It was time for a song.</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>I wish I was in Carrickfergus&#x2026;</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>My Dad used to sing that. I don&#x2019;t know if he ever made it to that to that particular protestant township, but that&#x2019;s where we were headed. We&#x2019;d skip Belfast for today and press on up the Antrim coast along the north side of Belfast Lough.</p>","<p>By the time we arrived at Carrickfergus Castle, the cold outside the car and the comfiness inside it reminded me and Tina of our day trip to <em>Die Wachau </em>a full year ago. If we&#x2019;d been able to persuade the boys to get out of the car to walk up to D&#xFC;rnstein castle on that occasion, they could easily besiege Carrickfergus Castle for an hour or so here. It had always been one of my ambitions to finally get us to Scotland on this trip (neither Tina or I had ever been), and although that would never happen we felt pretty close there at Carrick: it was only thirty or so kilometres, or eighteen or so miles, as they say around here, to Portpatrick. We could practically smell the bonny heather of Dumfries and Galloway.</p>","<p>Under a shocking blue sky we walked around the castle to a statue of a familiar figure. Maybe, as an Irishman, I was supposed to have a strong opinion about the infamous King Billy. At this stage though, he was practically a regular travelling companion for us: we&#x2019;d seen him at King John&#x2019;s Castle at Limerick; at Athlone, when we&#x2019;d met my brother and his kids at the Dublin-Connemara halfway house of Clonmacnoise, before going to Athlone castle for yet more history; and before leaving Ireland for good, we&#x2019;d hopefully get to meet him again at Br&#xFA; na B&#xF3;inne (the Boyne valley).</p>","<p>Always on the lookout for new board games, especially when, like <em>Carcassonne, </em>they connect us to history and to our travels, I was fascinated with one of the displays in the Castle. It was a medieval version of noughts and crosses called Nine Men&#x2019;s Morris set up in one of the banquet rooms. Consisting of twenty or so pebbles on a grid drawn on a block of wood it was known throughout Europe. To everyone&#x2019;s disappointment they didn&#x2019;t sell the game in the giftshop. A great pity: having lain dormant for so long, it could have enjoyed a twenty-first century renaissance in Australia.</p>","<hr>","<p>Early the next morning we waited in the Belfast&#x2019;s Holiday Inn car park in our rented car for a man we were about about to pay cash to to bring us to some of the city&#x2019;s worst spots, as you do. Overcast and freezing, this place was about as far away from Zakynthos, in every sense, as it was possible to be and still consider oneself to be in the same continent. At least it wasn&#x2019;t raining. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s beginning to rain,&#x201D; somebody said.</p>","<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s just spitting. I&#x2019;m nipping out for a quick walk. Back in a sec.&#x201D; This was my first time in Belfast. At around 175kms up the road from where I grew up, it amazed me to think I&#x2019;d never been here before, but really, with no relations here and with hotels like the Europa famous for being &#x201C;the most bombed hotel in Europe/the world&#x201D; why would I come here? Even scarier, as I noticed now, was the pavement outside Filthy McNasty&#x2019;s. Back at the car I clapped my hands together for warmth while the boys sank into the back seats to keep warm. A black cab, the sort familiar to Tina and me from our separate times in London, pulled up. A shaven-headed man got out and beckoned us over. We piled into the back of the cab, which is arranged so that you have to sit opposite each other, kind of like being on a train or in the carriage of a stagecoach in a cowboy movie. There was a license in a plastic sleeve from which I learned that this vehicle was called a &#x2018;Hackney carriage&#x2019;, and that our guide was called Brendan.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Right lads,&#x201D; Brendan began, turning to the boys while squatting in the wide-open doorway, &#x201C;have your Mummy and Daddy told ye about Nor&#x2019;n Ireland?&#x201D; He handed them each a sweet from a packet of butterscotches. They looked familiar to me.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Are they Callard &amp; Bowsers? Can I have one?&#x201D; Then I remembered where I was. &#x201C;Please?&#x201D;</p>","<p>With all four of us sucking on a Callard&#x2019;s, Brendan got started. &#x201C;Y&#x2019;see, Ireland is an ay-land,&#x201D; - it&#x2019;s hard to map the phonetic no-man&#x2019;s-land he had wandered off into with that word - &#x201C;but it&#x2019;s owned by two different countries. Isn&#x2019;t that right? Aye. And did your Daddy and Mummy tell you that there&#x2019;s two different groups of people who live in Nor&#x2019;n Ireland?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;The Catholics and the Protestants,&#x201D; said Alexander.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Aye, that&#x2019;s right. And they haven&#x2019;t always&#x2026;gotten on with each other. Did ye know that, lads?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Dad told us.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well today we&#x2019;re going to go for a wee drive and take a look at some of the places they lived in, the Catholics and the Protestants. And some places where some terrible faightin&#x2019; used to happen too. Alright? So strap in and we&#x2019;ll head off. Any questions?&#x201D;</p>","<p>Within a minute we were on one of the two most infamous roads on the island. &#x201C;Ok lads, we&#x2019;re on the Shankill Road now. This is where the Protestants live. We&#x2019;re going to have a look now at some of their murals in an estate near here.&#x201D;</p>","<p>We got off the Shankill and were soon in a warren of council houses in an obviously working class housing estate with here and there a flag or a figure painted on to a wall or the gable-end of a row of houses. Having parked and got out of the cab Brendan took us to the first exhibit on the tour, a garish mural completely dominating the end of a terrace of houses which was dedicated to a young guy with a backwards baseball cap, an earring and a gold chain with a gun on it around his neck. Stevie &#x2018;Top Gun&#x201D; McKeag, Military Commander. In large letters on a low wall on one side of the house it said &#x2018;UFF&#x2019;; &#x2018;UDA&#x2019; was on the other side. Alexander and Eoin were bound to be confused. I know I was. In Austria and Poland the military commanders we&#x2019;d seen pictures of in museums and castles didn&#x2019;t look like white rappers. </p>","<p>&#x201C;Do ye know why they called Stevie &#x2018;Top Gun&#x2019;, lads?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, they reckoned that he killed the most Catholics.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;How many did he kill?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Maybe up to twenty, although no-one&#x2019;s really sure. But they&#x2019;re sure he killed the most, so that&#x2019;s what they honour him on the wall like this.&#x201D;</p>","<p>We stood there in the cold and let that one sink in. A low-level background clatter of pots and pans and barking dogs came from the houses around us. Whose idea was this again?</p>","<p>&#x201C;I notice he died at the tender age of thirty,&#x201D; I said. &#x201C;How did he die?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, when the Troubles came to an end, there was no place in Nor&#x2019;n Ireland anymore for people like Stevie.&#x201D; Brendan made Stevie sound like The Little Prince, an extraordinary little chap from another planet, out of step with the humans among whom he chose to live temporarily. &#x201C;The official word was that he died of an overdose but the truth is he&#x2019;d become a bit of a liability to his own side when they were trying to work for peace, so there&#x2019;s always been rumours that it might not have been an accident.&#x201D;</p>","<p>This place was downright eerie; there was no other word for it. The Troubles may well have been over, but there was something very odd about a mural to a mass murderer in a public place. On the one hand, the dulling banality of rows of pebble-dashed council houses and scrappy, worn-out grassy spaces; on the other, the glorification of mass murder. Maybe this mural was no different to the statues, and even the TV programmes and books honouring the 1916 Easter Rising rebels that seemed to be everywhere this year, the centenary of the Easter Rising. Alexander and Eoin routinely came home from school singing stuff that you mightn&#x2019;t want too many Protestants hearing. The difference, it seemed to me though, was that Top Gun&#x2019;s victims seemed just to be ordinary members of the nationalist community, from Brendan&#x2019;s account, not soldiers or paramilitaries. Such is life here. No doubt there&#x2019;d be plenty of dubious antiheroes on the other side too that we&#x2019;d get to hear about as the tour wound its way out of the Shankill and into the Falls Road area. Walking back to the cab there were another three or so cabs parked near ours, with small groups being led by their own Brendans, these raconteurs of the abyss.</p>","<p>Driving out of the estate, Brendan told us that they don&#x2019;t tend to paint as many of those hagiographical murals on the Republican side of the fence. That&#x2019;s where we were headed now, and the Catholics were separated from Shankill by a &#x2018;Peace line&#x2019;, up to 18-foot high in places, between the communities, which, unbelievably, a good generation after the Good Friday Agreement, still exists. In fact, there are around a hundred of them scarring the city. Unlike the Berlin Wall, which of course they most readily bring to mind, they&#x2019;re still standing, and not just as outdoor museum pieces like the ones we&#x2019;d been to at Bernauer Strasse. These are working fences. Even today, they&#x2019;re better off up. At least, there are no concrete plans to take them down. Once again I was struck by the utter strangeness of it all.</p>","<p>At an extravagantly graffiti&#x2019;d section of the Peace line on Cupar Way, dismally photogenic in its own way, we alighted reluctantly from the warm cab again. Brendan handed the boys some markers and told them to do their worst. It sounded nice, the &#x2018;Peace line&#x2019;, and that particular stretch had plenty of uplifting and inspirational comments left by people from all over the world exhorting all parties to give peace a chance, but the barriers just resembled the sort of iron and barbed wire fence you&#x2019;d surround a factory with on the feral edge of a city.</p>","<p>At the nearby Bombay Street memorial to the riots that took seven lives in 1969, Brendan took a plastic baton round out of his pocket. It reminded me of the baton we used to use in relay races at school. A lot bigger, in other words, than I&#x2019;d thought a plastic bullet would be.</p>","<p>&#x201C;This street here that we&#x2019;re on - Bombay Street - was burned to the ground in 1969. There were snipers in the buildings pickin&#x2019; off people. Can ye imagine it, boys? Snipers! The violence spread all over Belfast. Within ten days there were over seven hundred homes destroyed. Thousands of families homeless. That was the spark that started everything.&#x201D;</p>","<p>He handed the bullet around so we could appreciate its malign heft.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Imagine being hit with one of these, boys.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Really, it was big enough that you could have just used it as a hand-held baton to twat someone over the head with. &#x201C;Have you ever been in any riots?&#x201D; I asked. Nonchalantly, and, given the temperature, bravely, he undid the top couple of buttons on his shirt to reveal some scarring around his sternum. &#x201C;Aye. And that&#x2019;s what a plastic bullet&#x2019;ll do to ye.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh wow! Ouch. Better than a real bullet, though. Although, that&#x2019;s obviously real, that plastic one. I mean, clearly. You know what I mean.&#x201D; He rolled up his trouser leg and revealed some scarring around his ankle.</p>","<p>&#x201C;And that&#x2019;s what a real bullet will do to you, lads.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh wow! Ouch!&#x201D; For fuck&#x2019;s sake, I thought to myself, stop provoking him before he reveals himself to be the Belfast Terminator, metal frame forged in the fires of the riots of &#x2018;69.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Right! Who&#x2019;s heard of Bobby Sands?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Me!&#x201D; My hand shot up. &#x201C;I mean, I have.&#x201D; In 1981 I used to keep a diary, and alongside football scores and the pop charts, I took to dutifully logging the name of each of the ten or so IRA hunger strikers as they died during the awful stand-off against the British government in or around May of that year. I suppose I must have thought it cool and rebellious to write their names like that in my diary. But it was affecting, to hear about those poor devils slowly killing themselves, to the indifference of the British government. At least, that&#x2019;s how I saw it at the time as a young teenager. It made quite an impression on me, the main effect of which was to never want to go near the North, not if I could help it. Ever. Very few teenagers in those days, I imagine, would ever have foreseen a scenario wherein they would one day bring their wives and kids into the lion&#x2019;s den, finally at peace, but still retaining the power to intimidate, as part of an organised tour, to be driven around to Protestant estates, to Berlin Wall-like &#x2018;Peace lines&#x2019;, to murals of Bobby Sands - poet, gaeilgeoir, revolutionary, IRA volunteer - and to gaze up into the grey sky at Divis Tower, imagining the night it was machine-gunned by armoured cars as rocks hailed down; and to be taken finally to an &#x2018;International Wall&#x2019;, entire sections of which were given over to lurid homages to freedom fighters the world over, and figures as diverse as Frederick Douglass and Fidel Castro, and where separatist slogans like &#x2018;Ireland stands with Catalonia&#x2019; turn factory walls into manifestos and history lessons, however partial the lessons. But that&#x2019;s indeed what we did that March morning.</p>","<p>When I was younger, I took advantage of the J1 visa programme to follow the well-worn path to the States beaten by many a young Irish lad and lassie looking to spend the summer working in a bar in Boston or a building site in San Diego. Hanging out with the gang of students I ended up working with on Cape Cod, I remember being appalled at their presumption that being from Ireland meant experiencing terrorism on a daily basis. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s in the north!&#x201D; I&#x2019;d say, outraged. &#x201C;I live in the south, in the Republic of Ireland. I&#x2019;m from Ireland, not Northern Ireland.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh sorry dude, I figured it was all the same,&#x201D; they&#x2019;d say. Then we&#x2019;d all get back to doing kegstands.</p>","<p>Over beers I complained to a friend, another Dub, who&#x2019;d been in the States a few years at that stage, about the Americans&#x2019; lack of knowledge about a country - mine - that for some strange reason I thought they should know more about. &#x201C;Sure if you stand on the Dingle peninsula, this is the next parish west. Practically. If you skip Newfoundland.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;You can see Wales from your house, on a good day, can you not? Sort of?&#x201D; inquired my friend.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Sort of. If I go up to the hill.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Tell me all about Wales.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know a thing about Wales.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Then shut up about the Yanks not knowing anything about Ireland.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Imagine expecting people on the other side of an ocean to know about the small island you come from when you didn&#x2019;t even know about your own neighbours, or even about good parts of your own country yourself. Well, that&#x2019;s what travel is for, I suppose. A journey of discovery in which you find out you&#x2019;re a bit of a ignoramus, and then you can try to fix that. We learned a lot that day in Belfast: me about my own country, or at least a province my country shares the island with, and Tina and the kids - well, God knows what they made of the darkness.</p>","<p>In the afternoon we learned about a completely different aspect of the city&#x2019;s history in the bizarre polygonal shape of the Titanic Museum. The next day was more peaceful: we took a drive along the north Antrim coast, starting with, naturally, the Giant&#x2019;s Causeway. I sat little Eoin down on the basalt columns and took a photo to commemorate the northernmost point in our &#x2018;Four Points of the Compass&#x2019; tour of Ireland that I realised we were inadvertently completing. Hook Head in Wexford had been south; Clifden - west; and of course, Killiney was east.</p>"],["<p>My lunchtime sessions with the guys in the office were going well, but I still wasn&#x2019;t speaking much Spanish because, naturally enough, when we hung out we all spoke English. It would just have been gauche and pretentious of me to try to get my new amigos to speak Spanish, given there were always Indians, Polish, French, and occasionally, even Irish people in the group too. One is either having a language class or one is eating sandwiches with one&#x2019;s colleagues, and in Mrs Doyle&#x2019;s kitchen one is eating sandwiches. I had to take this to the next level. Through the good offices of the TruePay HR department I sent an email out to the whole office soliciting interest in a Spanish language get-together. A dozen or so kind souls responded, and at a small meeting one afternoon, under the dour eye of a HR woman, I explained my plan: we&#x2019;d meet in the pub and talk Spanish. Genius.</p>","<p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s in it for them?&#x201D; the HR woman asked.</p>","<p>&#x201C;A beer,&#x201D; I answered. &#x201C;Two, if they want to do the irregular verbs.&#x201D;</p>","<p>In reality though, I knew most of them would come along just for the crack. Even though they spent their days working through the medium of English, some of them lived here in Dublin with other Spanish speakers and their grammar was still as raw as <em>jam&#xF3;n serrano</em>, since here in the office they mostly confined themselves to technical jargon. Sounding them out earlier I&#x2019;d sensed a genuine <em>afici&#xF3;n</em> on their part to speak better English, and an even more genuine one to hang out after work with a <em>cervezita</em>. I was happy to help them with both of those aspirations.</p>","<p>On a cold, clear Wednesday night in spring, at the bend where Cardiff Lane emerges onto the river on Sir John Rogerson&#x2019;s Quay and the convention centre shines a tilted reflection over the musical lines of the Beckett harp bridge, a Dubliner, a Mexican, a Murcian, a Valladolidian, a Szczeciner, and Murilo from Brazil walked into The Ferryman and lo!, <em>la Tertulia Espa&#xF1;ola Dublinesca</em> was up and running. <em>Tertulia</em>, by the way, is a great word I&#x2019;d found a few years earlier in Carlos Ruiz Zaf&#xF3;n&#x2019;s Barcelona-noir book <em>La sombre del viento</em>, a word my friends and I had used back in Brisbane as well to describe our get-togethers with our Mexican and Columbian friends. Cosy and warm-toned, The Ferryman was an old pub, but like some sort of intertidal zone invertebrate rapidly adapting to the radical change in its environment caused, in this case, by the explosion of twenty-first century office space all around it, changes that would have driven a less versatile species of pub into the tar pits of history, it was forced to offer lamb koftas and hot ciabattas alongside the beef and Guinness pie just to keep its head above water.</p>","<p>Since the <em>Tertulia </em>had been my idea, I was the <em>jefe</em>. I&#x2019;d think of a subject to talk about, we&#x2019;d stick to it for about ten minutes, and then the talk took the turn all talk does: it meandered like a river in directions unpredictable in advance, as if the very people making it had no control over it. It wasn&#x2019;t easy for some of us: Szceczin Jacek was learning Spanish, his third language, through English, his second; Murilo wasn&#x2019;t really interested in Spanish, and would compare and contrast every Spanish word we talked about to its Portuguese equivalent. Initially we tried freezing him out by moving on very quickly but his enthusiasm was such that eventually we gave up and actually learned some Portuguese too. Finally, Juan and Jesus were the engine room stokers of the <em>Tertulia</em>, stripped to the waist and shovelling coal for all they were worth. The <em>dramatis personae</em> may have varied from week to week, but for about two months that spring the traditional old docker&#x2019;s pub and hotel called The Ferryman was the cosy venue for <em>la Tertulia Espa&#xF1;ola Dublinesca</em>, possibly my finest hour here in Dublin.</p>"]]},{"index":12,"title":"The Grand Hôtel de France","pages":[["<p>Fear, other than chronic anxiety about the financial drain we were circling, had thus far been absent on this trip. Of the physical fear that whitens the knuckles and tightens the stomach we had known nothing. By and large we were carefree travellers, trusting in providence, <em>sans souci</em>, breezing across the landscape fully expecting things to work out, which they always did. But fear finally crossed our path at Easter. I got a little bit scared in France.</p>","<p>It all started a month earlier when the organisers of Ceoiltas decided to organise a trip away and asked for expressions of interest from members. If they could get a hotel in the Gorges du Tarn region in the Midi (south of France) to open up early in the season would anyone be interested in going on a trip over Easter? The kids&#x2019; accommodation would be subsidised. There&#x2019;d be day trips to surrounding villages, some rumoured to be quaint and photogenic. There&#x2019;d be Roquefort cheese for dinner, and singing. All everyone had to do was turn up at Dublin airport and Ceoiltas would arrange the rest. Would anyone be interested?</p>","<p>It had been a good four months since we&#x2019;d left the country. The apple tree in Mum&#x2019;s back garden had started to throw out some leaves and even a few red apples.Yes, we were interested. Having given a verbal commitment to Ceoiltas we then turned to the question of whether we actually should go. Of course we shouldn&#x2019;t. We had almost no money left, and I had only one week of paid employment remaining to me of my six-month contract. And anyway, there was a small chance we&#x2019;d actually be in the south of France in a couple of months. Were we not in the process of lining up some home stays and couches in Provence for early July? We were. In <em>Fever Pitch</em>, Nick Hornby&#x2019;s book about his lifelong obsession with Arsenal football club, he listed the qualities that a game has to have to be considered a &#x2018;classic&#x2019;. The usual things you&#x2019;d expect to see were there: a breathtaking display of individual skill, plucky underdogs coming back from the dead, but what stuck in my mind was his rule that a classic game should always have an outrageous refereeing decision. That was the spice that made the curry. A great journey should likewise include an outrageously bad decision, one so arrogant and wanton as to be financially ruinous or deleterious to the general success of the entire endeavour. Deciding, in our financial state, to go to the south of France, was an outrageous refereeing decision. So much so that this trip was well on its way to being a classic.</p>","<p>Until a couple of years ago I&#x2019;d never heard of Carcassonne. One night, chatting to my friend Noel back in Ireland, I asked him what he&#x2019;d been up to.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I went to Carcassonne with the wife and kids.&#x201D;</p>","<p>A while later, I had a nice chat with my brother back in Ireland. Catching up, the usual. What had he been up to, I wondered?</p>","<p>&#x201C;Went to Carcassonne with the wife and kids.&#x201D;</p>","<p>A pattern was emerging. I investigated and found out that Ryanair had started flying to Carcassonne with the wife and kids in 1998. It had become a gateway to the south of France, even Catalonia. Nowadays everyone goes there. And now here I was, stepping off the coach into the Midi sunshine one Easter morning, going to Carcassonne with the wife and kids. After playing the eponymous game for the past few months Alexander and Eoin finally got to walk within the real, actual crenellated curtain walls, with their machicolations, merlos, and murder machines, one weekday morning on their Easter holidays.</p>","<p>You enter La Cit&#xE9; M&#xE9;di&#xE9;vale - that&#x2019;s the restored medieval citadel everyone visits, the one with the conical terracotta and blue towers, not the real town behind it - through the Porte Narbonnaise, whose satisfyingly round towers and enormous arches are flanked by muscular buttresses and high, sturdy walls. The streets inside are packed with <em>fromageries</em> and souvenir shops vying with <em>creperies</em> and pizzerias. At that time of the year the plane trees were bare and stood guard in small pretty squares outside restaurants whose territorial claims, in the form of clumps of empty tables, filled nearly all the available space leaving only a narrow path for the traveller and his family to get through. Before long we were pleasantly lost. All the twists and turns give the place an authentically medieval feel. This is how towns used to be, I supposed: haphazard and rambling. We&#x2019;d bump into fellow Ceoiltas heads, also seemingly unconcerned with knowing their exact whereabouts, and just keep walking in no particular direction.</p>","<p>The walled fortress we were all wandering around in and taking photos of came about during the crusade against the Cathars prosecuted by Pope Innocent III in the early thirteenth century. But after a couple of centuries of neglect and military irrelevance following the annexation of Rouissillon by the Kingdom of France the cit&#xE9; had fallen into disrepair and was not considered to be worth saving, hard as that is to credit nowadays. People had moved to the lower town, and the ramparts of the cit&#xE9; were being quarried for their stone. A last minute reprieve on foot of public outrage over its proposed destruction brought about a makeover (of dubious authenticity, it must be noted) that gave us what we saw today. After a quick tour of the main castle, Ch&#xE2;teau Comtal (which we&#x2019;d just stumbled upon without knowing it existed beforehand), we sat down and had a <em>formule go&#xFB;ter</em> and <em>bi&#xE8;re pression</em> for lunch before filing back to the coach. We still had a long way to go to get to the Gorges du Tarn.</p>"],["<p>Through Cathar country we drove East that afternoon, along the coastal lowlands towards the sea, before swinging around south of the Parc Naturel R&#xE9;gional du Haut Languedoc, which we could see in the distance, into the high country again. &#x201C;The south of France, boys!&#x201D; I called out to Eoin and Alexander as the moment, and the coffee from the service station we&#x2019;d just stopped at, hit me. In the shopping centres of Brisbane you&#x2019;ll see shops called &#x2018;Occitaine&#x2019;, conjuring with that one magic word the essence of what was right outside our window right then, this region called Occitanie, full of lavender and sunflowers. You can go where you want on a trip around Europe, but there is - there surely is - a special place reserved in all but the most jaded traveller&#x2019;s heart for the south of France. And to think that week in April would be just the aperitif for the main course in July, if things worked out for us.</p>","<p>After B&#xE9;ziers the road slowly climbed up, up into the Languedoc, before winding dramatically down from the plateau into Millau, famous of course for the massive viaduct which spans the Tarn, the river in whose gorges we&#x2019;d be spending the next few days. We wound around Millau, allowing the Tarn lead us into some wild country on the far side, through a succession of small villages at the bottom of a deepening gorge until we came to a crossroads town called Le Rozier where the Tarn disappeared off north and the river Jonte took up the baton for the run to Meyrueis, our ultimate destination. From here things started to get good and hairy.</p>","<p>The valley we were in began to assume frightening (for me at least) proportions: we climbed higher and steeper on our side, leaving a correspondingly longer drop down to the bottom of the gorge. On the opposite side it just looked like a sheer wall. The edge of the road we were on (for the time being!) sloped away at forty-five degrees down into the rocky-looking river bed glistening prettily through the trees. One slip and that&#x2019;d be it. Weren&#x2019;t there some EU regulations about all this? I mean, one was in France, not Bolivia. Don&#x2019;t the bureaucrats know about this road? Other than the occasional low timber barrier made of half-metre high struts set into the gravel a metre apart, there was no containing wall at all for much of the way. Those few bits of wood were all that lay between the tarmacked shelf we were on and the abyss. Anything heavier, higher, and faster than a bicycle was going through or over that barrier if it hit it. Our only hope should we topple over would be that the trees might slow our progress, but they looked like they&#x2019;d hardly arrest the downward progress of a lamb with bulimia, let alone a coachful of Irish pleasure-trippers fattened for the slaughter on lunchtime <em>cr&#xEA;pes</em> and <em>frites</em> in Carcassonne. And there&#x2019;d be no-one to witness our perdition save the vultures circling evilly above the cliff-tops opposite us. I was keeping an eye on them. Any change in their behaviour would surely betoken expectation of imminent disaster. That, in turn, could well mean that they knew we were coming up to a black spot. Would they even distinguish us from the sheep that ended up in the gorge, their usual diet ? Ah, tinned food today, they might think, as they picked through the wreckage of the coach.</p>","<p>But the coach driver delivered us safely through the valley of death to the small village of Meyruis, population one thousand, where he deposited us at the Grand H&#xF4;tel de France late in the afternoon. With a name like that I felt the hotel was taking a bit of a <em>libert&#xE9;</em>, but the meal they served up that evening was indeed grand, and we did have the place to ourselves. Sure enough, there was a serving of roquefort during the meal. That alone was worth the flight over and the long coach trip and the fear and the circling vultures.</p>","<p>Even though the mold in the king of cheeses, <em>Penicillium roqueforti</em>, is unable to produce toxins under the conditions in which the cheese is made, kids think it can. People have known it&#x2019;s perfectly safe mouldy food for the past 9,000 years, but no-one told the kids. No, they just don&#x2019;t like it - at least mine don&#x2019;t - so I got theirs, and a sushi stack of plates soon wobbled in front of me. I considered licking them, but I got the eye from Tina. We all ate like kings, with unabashed pleasure. And the kings having eaten, the minstrels sang. People would start singing a song at their table without, in most cases, even standing up or turning around. At the chorus others would join in. It was like the old Irish tradition of <em>sean n&#xF3;s</em>, I supposed, just transplanted deep into the French countryside. Some of the songs were familiar. An architect from Dublin called actually John got up and called for silence before closing his eyes and singing <em>The Spanish Lady</em>. Dad used to sing that.</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>As I went down to-hoo Dublin ci-hi-ty\nAt the hour of twelve at night,\nWho did I see but the Spanish lay-hay-dy,\nWashing her feet by candlelight.</p>\n</blockquote>","<p><em>Follow Me Up to Carlow</em> came next. Its stirring call to arms became a favourite of Eoin&#x2019;s in the following months:</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>Curse and swear, Lord Kildare, Fiach will do what Fiach will dare,\nNow Fitzwilliam have a care, fallen is your star low\nUp with halberd, out with sword, on we&#x2019;ll go for by the Lord\nFiach MacHugh has given his word, Follow me up to Carlow</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>How did they remember the lyrics to all these great old songs? Especially when they were half-pissed and full of mouldy cheese. I was struggling to learn a few old favourites myself in my spare time at home. The music is easily learnt; it&#x2019;s remembering the lyrics to all the verses that stops you from being able to play the songs. It was a similar story in Greece. Sitting there with Tina and the boys with a Beaujolais and Roquefort buzz on me I thought it funny how I&#x2019;d never before realised how much of music, folk music certainly, boils down to sheer feats of memory, the more so considering the amount of booze that has usually been consumed at your typical trad session. Hidden away in a village over a thousand years old on a terrace of the Jonte in the long shadow of a scary valley, we listened to men and women sing Irish and English folk songs that stirred, in me at least, childhood memories, and stirred, too, the resolve in me to learn how to play them and sing them. They were still hard at it when we sloped off to bed with the kids. I fell asleep singing <em>The Spanish Lady</em> to myself.</p>","<p>In the face of so much spectacular scenery over the next couple of days Tina and I sometimes imagined that all this might, if we played our cards right, be just a warm-up for an active retirement, or pre-retirement, in which we&#x2019;d return to places like this and go deep. The idea that the hike we all did the next morning along the centuries-old <em>sentier, </em>from the village of Sainte-&#xC9;nimie, picking our way over ravines and through pines and cedars, past abandoned (or maybe just seasonal?) shelters, following the meandering Tarn, all the way to the village of Saint-Ch&#xE9;ly du Tarn - the idea this was the only time we&#x2019;d ever do this was maddening. I wished I was like the others I talked to on the track who knew this territory well and would be back in the coming years to camp or kayak, or hike these goat tracks. It was up to us to drink all this in: the <em>causses</em> above us, the river below, glittering, with every now and then a beach swelling out from the banks on which a fisherman might be seen. No, we wouldn&#x2019;t be back so easily. Not for us Australians the morning commute to the south of France we&#x2019;d done to get here this time. I really try to live in the moment, we both do, and to enjoy life as it comes to us, but how can one not feel a small bit frustrated at living so far from a place like this? We both felt here like we&#x2019;d felt at Lousios Gorge in the Peloponnese last summer: we&#x2019;d be back, with or without Alexander and Eoin.</p>","<p>At the small caf&#xE9; at Saint-Chely at the end of our walk, we sat out with an ice-cream and a Stella. On the square was a communal outdoor oven: before people had their own ovens they&#x2019;d all had to share one. While some stayed where they were and got another beer and others walked back to the coach, we took the chance to climb down some steps and ramps that led to the Tarn to place our hands in the river, to touch it at last. Looking back up at the village we&#x2019;d just been in we could now see a fine cascade of mountain water showering down from the old millhouse into the river.</p>","<hr>","<p>There was a tourist information bureau in Meyrueis&#x2019;s fetching old Horloge (clocktower) building, part of the original defensive walls of the cit&#xE9;. That&#x2019;s where I came across <em>Travels with a Donkey in the C&#xE9;vennes. </em>Towns like Meyrueis suffered years of decline and attrition during the continent&#x2019;s wars up until the advent of tourism in around 1880, from which they have benefited enormously. In that tourist office we found out that just outside town there was an old castle, Ch&#xE2;teau Roquedols, in which, rumour had it, the Mona Lisa had been sequestered during the second world war for safekeeping. On the grounds that it is vital that at some stage on an organised holiday the traveller resist the urge to climb back up those three welcoming steps into the coach, foregoing the comfort of a guided tour of a cheese factory or bird sanctuary, and instead take the road leading out of town, despite the cold, the drizzle, and their children&#x2019;s perfectly understandable reluctance, to go somewhere they found out about themselves. </p>","<p>Roquedols was a unicorn in the woods, its one Carcassonne-style cone glistening in the drizzle. Rounded towers glowed bright yellow with lichen. It had three-storey high curtain walls whose windows had been fetchingly shuttered up with mauve wooden slats. We stood looking up at it in perfect silence. I should have been in the office - it was my last scheduled week of the TruePay contract. Tina should have been in her course. Instead, we were in the woods somewhere in the south of France. This was &#x2018;<em>la France profonde</em>&#x2019;, the mythical France that every true Frenchman and woman yearns to escape into to escape the stultifying confines of their chic apartment in the <em>arrondissements</em> of Paris or Marseille. The sky was blue but red-tipped green buds were just beginning to come out on the tips of the branches.</p>","<p>In the afternoon we relaxed in our hotel room up on the third floor with the kids watching <em>Les Lapins Cretins</em> on TV and the shouts of the kids in the <em>&#xE9;cole</em> across the road coming in the window on the breeze. It reminded me of Easter in Zakynthos last year, seeing the kids all off the leash in the town just after we arrived.</p>"],["<p>Reveille on our last day was at 5am for a 6am d&#xE9;part in the chilly pitch-black for a bladder- and nerve-straining three-and-a-half hour coach epic to Carcassonne airport. We&#x2019;d be going out the same fearful way we came in, but in the pitch-black this time, at least for the first hour. Next stop would either be the set-down area of the A&#xE9;roport de Carcassonne or the bottom of the ravine. I had the fear again. Never in my life have I been happier to see the sun&#x2019;s rays come over our shoulders and light up the tops of the trees.</p>","<p>At the airport we bid adieu to the Ceoiltas heads. Having come all the way to the south of France we were damned if we weren&#x2019;t going to enjoy the weekend here. We found it curious that no-one in the group had thought to do the same. It was the weekend: why not go back on Sunday afternoon? Because they only lived two hours flying time away, and had become fashionably <em>blas&#xE9;</em> about France. We watched them leave, still scratching our heads, then hired a car and started off on the slow road to Toulouse from where we&#x2019;d fly home tomorrow. First stop today: the village of books.</p>","<p>Montolieu is a medium-sized town with about twenty bookshops. Thankfully, none of them is Borders or Barnes and Noble so they stick to the books and leave the lifestyle magazines and calendars out of it. We got there, parked, and walked up the only street in Montolieu with no bookshops. Undaunted, we read the only thing we could: a plaque on a rather old building, which said:</p>","<blockquote>\n<p>&#x201C;Here, in a former factory, at least 400 Spanish Republican refugees fleeing Francoist fascism were interned from February to September 1939. In homage to their suffering and their dignity PASSANT SOUVIENS-TOI!!!&#x201D;</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>We quietly remembered them - well, I couldn&#x2019;t with hand on heart really say we remembered them, but we we did observe a kind of silence for a few seconds. Well, ok, it wasn&#x2019;t silence as such, shattered as it was by an almost subsonic plaintive grumbling from Alexander and Eoin who just weren&#x2019;t into remembering Spanish Republicans that early in the morning - and then proceeded to the next street, which contained many bookshops.</p>","<hr>","<p>Didier was an aeronautical designer who worked in Toulouse for Airbus. He lived only half an hour&#x2019;s commute to the drawing board, in the village of Saint-Michel-de-Lan&#xE8;s, an island in a sea of wheatfields halfway between Toulouse and Carcassonne. In his mid&#x2013;50s, I&#x2019;d say, and stocky with it, he had one of those faces that was naturally suspicious of happiness and, if he was to be coaxed into smiling, it was only via a grimace that he managed to do so. Smiling was a state of affairs evidently not to his taste, and his expression would revert almost immediately to its resting state of squinting unease. His poor English meant that our stay with him was a chance for him to practice a little. &#x201C;<em>Je me d&#xE9;brouille en anglais</em>&#x201D;, he&#x2019;d said in his Airbnb profile, a phrase I&#x2019;d had to look up. It means &#x201C;I can get by in English&#x201D;, but he couldn&#x2019;t really - <em>se d&#xE9;brouiller en anglais</em>, that is. He was having a bit of a <em>blague</em> there, ol&#x2019; Didier was.</p>","<p>This was an Airbnb stay we&#x2019;d tacked on to the end of our Midi sojourn. It was one of those Airbnbs, though, which was more like a Couchsurf, insofar as our host would be staying in the house too. And in a first for us, when we&#x2019;d asked about restaurants in the area, our host offered home-cooked <em>cuisine r&#xE9;gionale</em>. He could cook for us at &#x20AC;12.50 a head for the adults, and &#x20AC;10 per kid. Tina had noticed on hosts&#x2019; pages that they sometimes offered services like pick-ups from the airport or laundry access, stuff like that, for money. Given the size of the village and the difficulty we thought we&#x2018;d end up having finding a decent place that Al and Eoin would be ok with, we accepted.</p>","<p>Chez Didier was right beside the village church, and those ol&#x2019; bells tolled out into the Cathar country air every hour. In the event, Didier was a bit of a gastronome, which was apparent when he called us down from our quarters to join him <em>&#xE0; table</em>, and we beheld, at each of our spots around the table, a mini-bowl containing a poached egg atop a salad. This disgusted Alexander and Eoin, befuddled Tina, who hates eggs, and, realising that I would have not one but four of these to eat, worried me. You see, I really didn&#x2019;t consider it good form in the man&#x2019;s house to start proceedings with pushed-back, refused plates. If they wouldn&#x2019;t eat them, I would. But would I have the stomach for the job? I like poached eggs as much as the next man, but not so much that I want to start a meal with four of them. Like Paul Newman in <em>Cool Hand Luke</em> I began putting eggs into my face.</p>","<p>Despite their hunger, the next course was no more to Alexander and Eoin&#x2019;s <em>go&#xFB;t</em> than the first had been. Strawberries in balsamic vinegar. What they wouldn&#x2019;t have given right then for some <em>spanakopita</em>, but Yiayia was a long way from Toulouse that Saturday night.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>&#xC7;a te plait?</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>Didier was solicitous of our satisfaction in the matter of his culinary performance, but being the only one who understood the question I was able to spin my response to suit the needs of the occasion.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Oui, &#xE7;a me plait.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>Possessing eyes in his head, however, he gazed glumly - not that he ever gazed at things in a different manner - at Alexander and Eoin, whose patent rejection of his labours threatened to derail the <em>bonhomie</em> of the <em>soir&#xE9;e</em>. On egg no.3 at this stage, there was nothing I could do. I was just delighted to be in a Frenchman&#x2019;s kitchen in <em>la France profonde</em> in the first place. He could have served up cornflakes and breadsticks, called it <em>pain au cereal</em>, and as long as he was happy to chat I&#x2019;d have been happy. And chat he did. Funnily enough, for someone who&#x2019;d insisted on the need to practice English, he bottled out of it at the first hurdle. <em>Pas de probl&#xE8;me</em> for me, since normally it&#x2019;s all one can do to get people to stick to French in these circumstances, but it hurt him. You could tell it in his face, his great big sad face. He&#x2019;d never really recovered from the trauma of the time he had Scottish people stay and hadn&#x2019;t been able to understand a word, and they hadn&#x2019;t spoken French, and they&#x2019;d all had to resort to Google Translate. And so we talked. He had a failed marriage behind him, and his ex was making him out to be a <em>mauvais type</em> with the kids so he&#x2019;d started airbnbing to make his payments to her. At one stage, his current <em>petite amie</em> phoned. He took the call at the table and I was glad to hear him reassure her: &#x201C;<em>Ouai, c&#x2019;est bon. On parle fran&#xE7;ais et anglais, tout les deux. C&#x2019;est bon.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<hr>","<p>Next morning, after a <em>boule de caf&#xE9;,</em> the potency of which would scrape the barnacles off a whaler, he told us to saddle up for a tour of the environs. The way Didier saw it, if his guests accede to having <em>d&#xEE;ner chez lui</em>, he considers them part of the team and is happy to show them the surrounding countryside the next morning.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>&#xC7;a te plait?</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Oui, &#xE7;a me plait. &#xC7;a me plait beaucoup. Allons enfants.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>Besides, he could do with the English practise. Which once again he flubbed. &#x201C;We drive to&#x2026;Canal du Midi&#x2026;because&#x2026;because&#x2026;je veut vous montrer les &#xE9;cluses, les all&#xE9;es&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Bon. Merci.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Around an azure, dagger-shaped lake we drove, past fields of swishing wheat and the occasional mini-peleton of cyclists, before ending up at the canal and its plane tree alleys full of criss-crossing shadows. I read a notice at one <em>all&#xE9;e de platanes: </em>&#x201C;Planted in 1809, this beautiful all&#xE9;e leads to the &#xC9;cluse de l&#x2019;Oc&#xE9;an (the Lock of the Ocean). It is composed of 62 plane trees nearly 45m high, the largest of which measures 4.17m in circumference, and is one of the most beautiful in France.&#x201D;</p>","<p>In the time-honoured manner of people with nothing better to do on a spring morning than watch the <em>va-et-vient</em> of traffic on the Midi waterways, we sat on the edge of the lock as a German family on a barge called the <em>Ville de Cholet</em> drained one chamber, filled the other, and continued on their way, while a man in combat pants and cap fished off the same lock quay. Exploring the path nearby we came upon a terrace of two houses called <em>la Maison de l&#x2019;&#xC9;cluse</em> which was for sale, instantly triggering the sort of ridiculous fantasy about buying it and retiring there to which Tina and I too often succumb. Didier was on hand to make sure we were all having a good time.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>&#xC7;a te plait?</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Oui, ca me plait beaucoup, Didier. Merci.</em>&#x201D;</p>"]]},{"index":13,"title":"Theseus Walk, the Angel","pages":[["<p>The force was with us in London over the May Day weekend to judge by all the Star Wars posters and books in the Islington Airbnb flat we were staying in. Our Jedi&#x2019;d-up <em>pied-&#xE0;-terre</em> was sandwiched between City Road and Regent&#x2019;s Canal in a backwater intriguingly named Theseus Place. Theseus, it turns out, was the mythical king and founder-hero of Athens. Athens would be the last place we&#x2019;d be seeing on our trip - our odyssey&#x2019;s Ithaca - if all went according to plan. And we&#x2019;d be seeing a small bit of that city over this weekend in London too. We wouldn&#x2019;t get to meet the flat&#x2019;s owner though, which was a shame, because she sounded interesting. According to her kitchen calendar she&#x2019;d gone to Morocco on a fashion shoot.</p>","<p>Walking to and from Angel tube station took us past a leafy one-hundred metre stretch of canal with a dozen or so colourful barges that seemed to be inhabited. Wondering where it went, I looked the canal up on the map and saw that it dead-ended right there at Angel, but if you were to punt along in the other direction, east, you&#x2019;d pass through Bethnal Green and Mile End before finally ending up in the Thames at Limehouse Marina. Ever since I lived here as a young buck of twenty one I&#x2019;ve been fascinated with London&#x2019;s twists and turns. I used to go out on weekends with the SLR (single lens reflex) camera my Dad had given me and take photos around the city that I could barely afford to get processed. You and your fancy camera phone nowadays.</p>","<p>After settling in to our place we caught the number 38 bus from Islington High Street to New Oxford Street, moseyed briskly up busy Museum Street, turned right onto Great Russell Street, entered the vast British Museum courtyard and ascended the steps of the great columned fa&#xE7;ade with the hordes to shuffle reverentially into the Great Court with its geometrically-patterned glass ceiling, at which point we felt, finally, that our London trip had properly started. As travelling parents, we were blessed by the fact that Alexander and Eoin actually enjoyed museums. We could easily imagine a universe in which one&#x2019;s children had to be bribed or spanked into enduring a couple of hours in some fusty old building while their parents oohed and aahed over a vase, but that wasn&#x2019;t our universe. In any case, museums are full of weapons, are they not? Kids love those. In fact, an army could do worse when it invades a country than to take control of the museums first. A bit antiquated some of the ordnance may be, but there&#x2019;s no gainsaying the stopping power of a falchion sword. Some of the best memories we&#x2019;d had on this trip so far were in places like the Wien Museum, Berlin&#x2019;s Pergamon, and Adam&#x2019;s guided tour of the Arms Museum in Ko&#x142;obrzeg. In the lead-up to this weekend we&#x2019;d worked the lads up to a frenzy about The British Museum, maybe the mother of all museums.</p>","<p>From their investigations Alexander and Eoin knew about the Elgin &#x2013; sorry, Parthenon &#x2013; Marbles &#x2013; sorry, Sculptures. The Parthenon Scuptures, that&#x2019;s it. At precociously young ages, they&#x2019;d both walked &#x2013; one might even say toddled - the time-worn stones of the Acropolis, and in fact we hoped to be walking them again in a few months and visiting the new museum there, the one the Greek government built in the expectation of getting the Marbles - Sculptures! &#x2013; back.</p>","<p>It&#x2019;s possible to think, as many do, that there&#x2019;s something amiss with the sculptures resting in Bloomsbury in perpetuity, while at the same time acknowledging that they are indeed displayed on a world stage here, for all to enjoy, gratis, right in the heart of empire. All beaten-up and a long way from home they may be, but the grandeur of their setting in the West Wing, built only for them, is moving. At least, that&#x2019;s the main point made by the Trustees of the Museum in response to periodic requests from the Greek government that they be returned whence they came, viz. the Parthenon. &#x201C;Lord Elgin, the British diplomat who transported the sculptures to England, acted with the full knowledge and permission of the legal authorities of the day.&#x201D; is how they swat away allegations of vandalism of misguided Hellenophiles like Elgin. Of course, the problem with that statement, as any Greek, for instance my wife, will tell you, is that those legal authorities weren&#x2019;t Greek at the time, but Ottoman.</p>","<p>The Trustees further justify their position thus: the Museum&#x2019;s horde, which constitutes 30% of the pieces that weren&#x2019;t blown up by the Venetians several hundred years ago, is not known as the &#x2018;Elgin Marbles&#x2019; anymore, oh no: the correct appellation is &#x2018;The Parthenon Sculptures&#x2019;. They&#x2019;ve been on permanent display - for free - in the Museum for two hundred years, and there they shall remain. What&#x2019;s more (it goes on), it&#x2019;s not as if they&#x2019;ve all been commandeered by the British Museum: just as many (30%) are in the new(ish) Acropolis Museum in Athens, not to mention the six other museums throughout Europe hanging on to some, among them the Louvre and the Kunsthistorisches Museum of Vienna (somehow we&#x2019;d missed that nugget of information during our research into Vienna). So, no, they shan&#x2019;t be going back to Athens any time soon. Good <em>day</em>, sir!</p>","<p>The boys led us to a striking turquoise Mixtec/Aztec double-headed serpent sculpture that they&#x2019;d known to look for from a book they&#x2019;d picked up at home in a second-hand bookshop in Dalkey. Kudos to the pair of them for finding out about that. They were actually getting to the stage where they could teach their parents a trick or two. The Rosetta Stone was another of those big-ticket items normally hidden behind a thick layer of glass and irritating people who got there before you did, so when I found a copy of it in the Library, a copy you could actually touch, I suddenly realised how much I wanted to touch it. It&#x2019;s funny; running your fingertips over the lettering, even of a (very convincing) facsimile, is the most natural thing to do. It&#x2019;s not enough to just look at it. You want to feel the words. I decided there and then that the measure of a great museum is that it lets you feel things, not just look at them.</p>","<p>Unlike most of the museums in Vienna and Berlin, entrance to The British Museum was free, but let there be no doubt about one thing: you are not walking out of this place in the same financial shape as you walked into it. So many wonderful books! Piles of Neil MacGregor&#x2019;s <em>A History of the World in 100 Objects</em> tempted me almost beyond resistance, but as befits anyone travelling around Europe in this day and age, belt-tightening and austerity were our catchwords. Of course we had to loosen the purse strings the following day in Hamley&#x2019;s, whose life-size Lego Queen and cringeworthy staff bursting into song oh-so spontaneously were, respectively, among the highlights and lowlights of our weekend.</p>"],["<p>At the end of a raw spring week sleet and windy, Sunday turned the corner into May, eager to make amends. I&#x2019;ve always thought London scrubbed up nicest in May and June. The year I met Tina, she was living in Notting Hill. I used to fly over to see her every couple of weekends that Cool Brittania June, grateful to be alive and in love and in London.</p>","<p>Maybe I&#x2019;d just been listening to too many Shane MacGowan songs, but I&#x2019;d forgotten, a decade and a half later, how pretty Leicester Square can be. Thick with tourists, touts, and down and outs as it usually is, it&#x2019;s hard to appreciate its grandeur under normal circumstances, but early on a bright Sunday morning we saw the square with the Bard and the Little Tramp in a clean pure light, free of its usual hawkers and prozzies. Trafalgar Square, too, seemed to have a lot less pigeons than I remembered it having. Had there been a clean-up? In The National Gallery Eoin got to see Van Gogh&#x2019;s <em>Sunflowers</em>, which he&#x2019;d been reading about at school, in the flesh at last.</p>","<p>We had a midday rendezvous with Nathan, an old friend from Brisbane who moved to London a decade ago, so we kept moving, up Haymarket, by Eros at Piccadilly Circus, skirting the bottom of Regent Street, until at St. James Park we met Nath and his wife Ali. I remembered well the session in Brisbane to see Nath off on his big move to the UK, only to find out a few days later that because of some passport or Visa snafu he&#x2019;d been refused entry at Heathrow and gruffly told to buy a ticket and go sit in the departures lounge to wait for the next plane home. I didn&#x2019;t attend the second going-away drinks session, which was quieter than the first by all accounts.</p>","<p>Today was a day for walking, at least to the nearest good pub. On our right as we went up Horse Guards Road the people queueing up for the Churchill War Rooms had the right idea getting out of the sun for a short while. Through Admiralty Arch we saw Nelson&#x2019;s Column a second time, then went up St. Martin&#x2019;s Lane into the heart of theatre land, stopping for a swift one in The Salisbury. Well, it would have been remiss to pass by such a storied establishment, one that featured in <em>The Boat that Rocked</em> and <em>Victim</em>. We turned down New Row into Covent Garden, where some of our party felt the need to stop and watch one of those magician/street entertainer types, the ones with a headset and who maintain a slick patter of tosh while conscripting hapless Dads into their unfunny shtick, dragging it out for an eternity. Not a fan.</p>","<p>Waterloo Bridge opened up a vista along the Thames at last, and took us to the Southbank, a magical concrete art-place where I used to watch Kurosawa films in the National Film Theatre when I worked here as a youngster. It was thronged with fellow lunchgoers now, struggling like us to get in anywhere. We ended up having to sit at the back of a packed chain bistro just to be able to eat. Skatepunk types did their thing in the park outside, upbeat mariachi music drifted in from somewhere, and the booksellers&#x2019; tables turned the Thames embankment into the <em>rive gauche</em> of Paris.</p>","<p>After lunch we continued on the Queen&#x2019;s Walk (turns out that&#x2019;s the name of that particular stretch going east along the river) and soon found ourselves at a place called Gabriel&#x2019;s Wharf where a brass/funk/megaphone-totin&#x2019; ensemble playing down on the dark sand of the Thames shore sent festive vibrations into the air. I&#x2019;ve always found it strange and lovely that here and there along the embankment of the Thames, in the middle of a city where aquaria, dungeons, cathedrals and towering glass Shards flower on the river&#x2019;s edge, you can also still find the odd beach.</p>","<p>Blackfriar&#x2019;s Bridge, the Tate, the Globe, the Clink: waypoints eastward towards Hay&#x2019;s Galleria, where The Golden Hinde recalled the era of the tall tea clippers from India and China which edged their way into the dock one hundred and fifty years ago, back when it was known as the &#x201C;Larder of London&#x201D; on account of the amount of food which passed through the area. We read that Shackleton&#x2019;s Quest even stopped off there in 1921. Across the Thames, monumental buildings like St. Paul&#x2019;s and oddities recalling household items, like the Gherkin, the Cheesegrater, and the Walkie-Talkie, helped us orient ourselves. We were, at that point, walking virtually in the shadow of the Shard which, at 310 metres tall, casts a pretty long one, but at &#xA3;74.95 for a view from the top was simply not an option. At HMS Belfast, just before Tower Bridge, we called our Mayday walk a day and looked for the nearest hostelry. One street in from the embankment through Potters Fields, The Bridge on Tooley Street furnished us with restorative pints of Spindrift and packets of Walkers while we waited for Simon to turn up.</p>","<p>Simon was the paterfamilias of the travelling and blogging Aussie family we&#x2019;d met in Dublin last August. They&#x2019;d been on their way out of Ireland when we met them up in Killiney Castle, near Mum&#x2019;s, just as we were settling in for the winter. Knowing they were holed up temporarily in London we contacted them to see if they fancied a pint. Simon joined us in The Bridge just in time for the second round. We spoke about what it was like to housesit in London and France and all that other good travelly stuff.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think that I&#x2019;d want to live in London anymore,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s really, really busy. Housing is ridiculously overpriced and everyone is working too hard to make a life. I just don&#x2019;t think that after all the changes that we&#x2019;ve made to our lifestyle we could return to both working full time just to pay the bills.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Nath agreed, saying they&#x2019;d seen more houses than your man from Grand Designs before they eventually ended up buying in West Ham. Having both once lived in London &#x2013; separately &#x2013; Tina and I were happy to leave it at just the once. I was a bit worried though that so much travelling would leave me like Simon, unable to readjust to civilian life. The reason I was trying to squeeze as much out of our trip as I could was because, unlike him, I did face the prospect of having to return to working full-time and paying off a mortgage. But that was a good way off yet. Not counting Ireland, on this trip Alexander and Eoin had already been (in alphabetical order) to Berlin, Bratislava, Brussels, Budapest, Gdansk, the Midi, and Vienna, with Athens to come, hopefully. It had always been our plan on this trip to show them one or other of what I called the two &#x2018;world cities&#x2019; of Europe they hadn&#x2019;t already been to: London or Paris. Now they could say that they&#x2019;d been to mother London, and while it was still in the EU, what&#x2019;s more.</p>"]]},{"index":14,"title":"Riverfalls, Clifden","pages":[["<p>It&#x2019;s a terrible thing to sell a house - a house you saw being built, a house to whose unpainted front door you had to walk over a sagging plank to get, spanning the muddy puddles where the front patio out of which you&#x2019;d spend many an afternoon sweeping the leaves would one day be. A house whose every piece of furniture that didn&#x2019;t come from the wedding gifts of a few months earlier had to be scouted out in large showrooms on the outskirts of Galway and hauled the fifty miles west to Clifden. A house whose mantelpiece was made from chunks of red granite hewn from a Sky Road quarry. A house whose upstairs you excitedly inspected, reachable at that early stage only by leaning a wooden ladder against the otherwise empty stairwell and avoiding protruding nails, because it had a balcony, which, given the weather round those parts, you ended up hardly ever using, and which in fact gave you nothing but trouble in the form of a huge damp spot on the kitchen underneath it, for the first year or so. A house with a back patio at the foot of which flowed the Owenglen river on its way down to Clifden Bay. A house you entertained in, drank to excess in, and paid the price in.</p>","<p>It&#x2019;s a sad thing to sell a house alright, the first you bought, the one you shared with a woman from the other side of the world in a small town on the barren west coast of the continent and lived in for several years before realising that your future lay not in that house but in another one, any other one, far from there. It&#x2019;s a sad thing to rent that house to people you don&#x2019;t know, people who do mickey-mouse paint jobs to patch up the damp when they really should take their time and do it right, and who carve their names on the furniture and leave their wives.</p>","<p>That house was us, once. It was where we came from, the two of us. I have photos and videos of us as happy as Larry in our new house. But it was no longer us. We had to sell it. I had had to let many years pass before I allowed myself the relief of admitting that, finally, I just wanted shot of it. My happy memories of living there, I realised, would no longer be threatened by selling it. It wasn&#x2019;t making us money, and we were tired of receiving automated warnings from Bank of Ireland about the mortgage repayments we kept missing, bled dry as we were making the mortgage repayments on our house in Brisbane. Selling it had always been a part of the &#x2018;admin&#x2019; part of this trip. But, with all our living the life of Reilly in France, Belgium, Portugal, and Spain, we&#x2019;d missed the deadline of the four months notice we needed to give our tenants, a local fisherman and his two grown sons, if we wanted them out in time so we could get the house cleaned and painted and shipshape, which apparently it wasn&#x2019;t.</p>","<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s rough as fuck, like,&#x201D; the Clifden painter and decorator I&#x2019;d asked to take a look said. &#x201C;The walls are covered in grease. They fry up the fish with the windows closed,&#x201D; he said, in a Connemara accent you could bottle and sell in a craft shop in Letterfrack.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Would it be possible to fix it up while they&#x2019;re still living in it?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ah God, no,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;Sure you&#x2019;d kill them with the paint fumes.&#x201D;</p>","<p>He wasn&#x2019;t interested, nor was anyone else. In desperation I dangled a month&#x2019;s free rent in front of the fisherman, conditional upon him leaving the house within the month, hoping he&#x2019;d take the bait. He bit, and duly left. We were going to have to go down and clean and paint the place ourselves, leaving the kids in Dublin to finish school.</p>"],["<p>Maybe for the first time this entire trip - we certainly couldn&#x2019;t remember another - we got in a car and drove the length of a country away from our boys. That&#x2019;s a terrible thing to do, up there with selling a house, but it felt great. They had school to go to, and Mum would probably spoil them a little while we were gone. So we took the M50 around the bottom of Dublin to where it connects to the westbound M4, aimed &#x2018;er at Galway, and put Al and Eoin out of our minds.</p>","<p>At Kilbeggan we got off the motorway and drove through town, stopping for a cuppa at a place that actually made its own chocolate. We talked with the chocolatetier himself, gazing at the distillery on the far side of the river Brosna, surrounded by land that has reverted over the past generation to a pristine, wild state called &#x2018;bypassed Ireland&#x2019;. In Galway we strealed around the famous Claddagh and up the canal walk behind the R&#xF3;isin Dubh, reminiscing about gigs we&#x2019;d driven in from Clifden to go to, years ago. We&#x2019;d had some good times over the years before moving to Australia, but we didn&#x2019;t dwell on them too long before hitting the last bit of the road to Clifden. We had come west to bury memories, not to rekindle them.</p>","<p>Early the next morning we turned the key and let ourselves into our house, fearing the worst. And indeed, it was in a bit of a state. After the initial inspection I found myself relieved, having expected it to be worse, but Tina, for all her Greek heritage, couldn&#x2019;t match my stoicism.</p>","<p>&#x201C;What did you expect?&#x201D; I asked her.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Not this,&#x201D; she answered, despondent.</p>","<p>There were black clouds of mould on the walls. Every one of them would have to be repainted. The cooker top might have to be sandblasted. Someone had created a neat handle-shaped hole in the wall where handle met wall. Someone, possibly the same person, had carved letters into the varnished wood of the master bedroom. Someone, probably the very same ne&#x2019;er-do-well, had spat out wads, now ossified and resistant to change, of chewing gum everywhere, both outside in the front patio, and inside. It was all our fault - mine, actually, being the one with the Irish connection - for letting things slide for so may years. We&#x2019;d been the accursed absentee landlords in Australia. Determined to turn this onerous situation into a last hurrah, we&#x2019;d spend a last couple of weeks in Clifden. Once the end of June came and the kids finished school we&#x2019;d leave Clifden, Connemara, Dublin, the country. So we put our headphones in, fired up our podcast players, and got cracking. </p>","<p>Among their other sins, the tenants had let the back patio get completely overgrown with moss, underneath which were the pavers we needed to see again to tick off that particular job. What I quickly discovered out there with my spade was that the midges, who emerge annually for the first time around mid-May, had been there first. Midge eggs develop over six weeks, so whether it was the overprotective females defending the yet-to-hatch eggs, or the hatched and hyperactive youngsters fighting the Spade of Righteousness - either way, hacking at that moss was total war. I could last ten minutes at a time before having to retreat, shocked and giddy with the bites.</p>","<p>Day by sunny day we plugged away at the chewing gum, the mould, the moss and the midges. We painted for hours each morning and afternoon and on long evenings we&#x2019;d go for drives and watch the evening light over the bog paint dragon-backed Roundstone Mountain orange and red. We sat in our front room one evening, one of the last few times we&#x2019;d ever do that, and watched <em>The Trip to Italy</em> on the 14&#x201D; Panasonic TV I&#x2019;d won years ago in Humanity Dick&#x2019;s pub, wondering if we&#x2019;d get to Piedmont (probably, being near France) or Capri (probably not, being nowhere near France) in the coming month or two.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s have long boozy lunches and do impersonations when we get to Italy.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well be doing work exchange, remember? We&#x2019;ll be cutting the grass, loading the dishwasher, and doing maths with the kids.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;If the weather is as good as this I don&#x2019;t care. And we can still do impersonations. I do a mean Jacob.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Jacob? Ciara&#x2019;s Jacob? Impersonations are supposed to be of famous people.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Those are celebrity impersonations. Anyone can do those. Anyway, at this stage people like Michael Caine are virtually impersonating themselves. No, the real artist does people who aren&#x2019;t well known, like the guy down in the vegetable shop. Nobody knows who you&#x2019;re supposed to be. You have to be really good for people to get it,&#x201D; I said, imitating the accountant on Bridge Street we&#x2019;d seen the day before about our Irish tax returns. Tina didn&#x2019;t get it. I had to work on that one.</p>","<p>Alexander and Eoin, who&#x2019;d finished school, brought good things with them. For the whole week, as if in honour of our valedictory travails, the weather was only famous. Hard work in the morning was followed by afternoons walking over Cleggan Head or swimming in Mannin Bay. The shocking cold I felt sitting in the water looking north at the Twelve Bens rise abruptly out of the foreshortened bog was an unforgettable moment on this trip. I still shiver to recall it. In Greece one relaxes in the water. Sleep is a distinct possibility. In contrast, one feels alive in the water in Ireland. Another day we did the Lough Inagh drive, stopping for a pint in Leenane in the pub with all the Bull McCabe photos on the wall from the time they shot <em>The Field</em> nearby. Still, we never once used our balcony back at the house. Not even on sunny days. You just never think to use a balcony in Ireland, even if you own one.</p>","<p>And then one day - the walls painted, the gum scraped, and the mould chemically erased - we closed the door behind us and turned the key for the last time. We left them with the real estate agent: the fate of the house was in her hands now. We said goodbye to my brother and his family, who live just up the road from our house, and took off. Only one piece of business remained for us in the west: in a hotel in Athenry, over a carvery lunch with extra tomato sauce and Guinness we all watched Ireland&#x2019;s Euro Championships dreams evaporate at the cruel hands of Les Bleus.</p>","<hr>","<p>We&#x2019;d miss Clifden. We&#x2019;d miss Dalkey. We&#x2019;d miss games night with Ciara and Jacob. We&#x2019;d all miss the Friday night music and the craic down at Ceoiltas. I actually bumped into M&#xE1;ire in her regular busking spot on a laneway off Grafton Street just before we left. She was a tiny, curled up figure, sitting with her box of CDs, talking to one of the Waterboys, a well-known &#x2018;Celtic&#x2019; folk rock band.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Conas at&#xE1; t&#xFA;?</em>&#x201D; she asked me. &#x201C;<em>An bhfuil t&#xFA; go maith?</em>&#x201D; I bought one of her CDs, hoping to be reminded back in Australia of winter evenings in the Georgian house in Monkstown, of trying to push out sentences in Irish, and the thrill of occasionally doing so.</p>","<p>This chapter of our journey&#x2019;s book, the Irish one, the longest one, with its castles, its Tertulias in the Ferryman and lost afternoons in Finnegan&#x2019;s, had come to an end. Alexander and Eoin had finished school, the one we&#x2019;d had trepidations about originally but which in the end turned out grand. They joined chess clubs, learned rebel songs, and played violin for a 1916 Commemoration concert. As typical Aussie kids, they&#x2019;d outclassed their peers in swimming and, from a standing start, had picked Irish up quickly enough to be able get through the syllabus. With the UK voting to leave the EU, we were likewise making our own exit preparations: Ireland first, and in three months the EU. Those three months would be filled with stints in France, Italy, and Greece, where we&#x2019;d see Mum again. That was the plan, but it was a fragile one, depending as it did on a couple of work exchanges that sounded tough, simply because they seemed to involve real, actual work, not minding kids like we&#x2019;d done in Vienna and Ko&#x142;obrzeg.</p>","<p>On the first morning in July Jacob dropped us back to the airport, bookending the job he&#x2019;d started when he picked us up from our flight from Berlin the previous August. We never did get to go with him to Amsterdam on one of his quarterly trips home to see his mother.</p>"]]},{"index":15,"title":"The Island in the middle of Provence","pages":[["<p>A chap got up from his seat two rows behind us on the Toulouse-N&#xEE;mes train to have a go at the family in the four-seater space opposite us, whose kids were - fair enough - being a bit noisy, albeit harmlessly so, I felt, since they looked like nice people, and while naturally I couldn&#x2019;t catch everything the guy was saying it was definitely some sort of appeal to the mother to keep the kids&#x2019; jabber down, but she, long-legged and splendid of hair, kind of like Michelle Obama, tranquilly rebuffed his every plaintive &#x201C;Mais Madame&#x2026;&#x201D; with the unhurried observation that kids will be kids. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s just how they are. I don&#x2019;t have a choice.&#x201D; To which he answered &#x201C;<em>Moi non plus, Madame</em>,&#x201D; before turning away, having failed to receive satisfaction, whereupon the kids&#x2019; father, hitherto uninvolved, offered the guy a desultory shrug and a &#x201C;<em>Desol&#xE9;!</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>The chap had the hump because instead of proceeding at a good <em>allure</em> through Languedoc-Roussillon, which he should have been doing, to his consternation he found himself, like the rest of us, immobile in a field somewhere between Carcassonne and L&#xE9;zignan-Corbi&#xE8;res, on account of an accident which the driver, who&#x2019;d been on the intercom a couple of times by that stage to keep us <em>au courant</em>, had informed us would set the itinerary back by two hours. We saw the victim not half an hour later, covered up with a blanket by the side of the tracks and surrounded by gendarmes when finally, and at the pace of an <em>escargot</em>, we transited gare L&#xE9;zignan-Corbi&#xE8;res, wondering what had happened exactly, but imagining, me at least, that it must have been a suicide.</p>","<p>&#x201C;It takes a long time to find all the body parts&#x201D;, a German guy in a singlet facing me across the aisle said, helpfully, to the two English guys he&#x2019;d been chatting to beside him, a chat during which I learned that he&#x2019;d been to all the Euro 2016 games so far. But the train was picking up speed now; people relaxed. We were near the coast, past Narbonne, and we could just about see the Mediterranean out to the east, all of a haze. There it was, the same water we&#x2019;d spent so much time in last spring! With a pinking sunset, we arrived at N&#xEE;mes nearly two hours <em>en retard</em> with our plans for our first evening on this, our second and final <em>s&#xE9;jour</em> of this trip in France, in disarray. Would the guy whose apartment we were renting still be waiting for us?</p>","<p>Standing outside the station in the twilight, well over a thousand kilometres and half a day away from Dublin, the air felt like warm honey. The station itself, in what looked like sandstone, seemed to be a two-storey facsimile of the most famous building here, <em>Les Ar&#xE8;nes</em>, the Roman coliseum-type edifice, still used, <em>mirabile dictu</em>, for spectacles with animals. The fragrance on the ebbing day&#x2019;s warmth persuaded us not to catch a taxi from the station to our apartment but to drag our stuff straight up Avenue Feuch&#xE8;res, along the decorative aqueduct running its entire length, all the way to <em>Les Ar&#xE8;nes</em>, and to make our own way home. Despite the hour, parents were still out walking with young kids. We relaxed a little, telling ourselves we couldn&#x2019;t help the delay, we&#x2019;d contacted our host, and anyway, people do things later here on the continent, don&#x2019;t they?</p>","<p>On a street with a great name, <em>Rue de la R&#xE9;publique</em>, we passed a bar with an even greater one, <em>Le Tout Va Bien</em>, and kept going, wheeling our suitcases over bumps and cracks along the narrow <em>trottoirs</em>, up this street, down that boulevard, until we found <em>Rue Fran&#xE7;ois 1er</em> and sat our weary luggage down. I rang the doorbell. Julien, the owner, appeared almost immediately.</p>","<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re so sorry.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Oh la la, &#xE7;a ne fait rien. Bienvenu a N&#xEE;mes.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>Julien was a <em>pompier</em>, a fireman. He knew all about bodies on tracks and train delays. It still amazed us to be able to just turn up in a back street of a strange city and occupy someone&#x2019;s apartment, butter and tomatoes still in the fridge, guitar on a stand in a corner, bicycle hanging from the wall. The guitar was reasonably in tune but the bike tires were flat (why I check people&#x2019;s tires, I don&#x2019;t know, but I do, so if you&#x2019;re expecting me you might want to get the pump out beforehand). There was a globe with a Mr. Men cartoon book propped against it, featuring Mr. Happy (<em>Monsieur Content</em>), a large plastic pink flamingo which would fall down alarmingly loudly a few times over the next two days, and, tellingly, postcards from all over the world on his fridge. Like many of the people we&#x2019;ve met who rent their places like this, Julien was himself a keen traveler. He&#x2019;d been doing Airbnb rentals for two or three years at that stage, and had moved into his girlfriends&#x2019; place nearby for the season. Once the summer was over they were off to Myanmar.</p>","<p>On account of the unreasonableness of the hour, we hadn&#x2019;t had a chance to buy anything like cheese, wine, or bread, so I had a cheeky look in the fridge, putting out outrageous hints. Julien took out a bottle of Muscadet and told us to help ourselves, <em>pas de probl&#xE8;me</em>. <em>Tr&#xE8;s sympa!</em> As he left he handed me the keys to the place, and I felt in the sweat of my palm a tiny laminated boomerang. As I lay in bed that night with the fan on I looked at a wall-sized map of the world and thought it funny how small - how absolutely tiny Europe is - this continent we were lavishing so much attention on.</p>","<hr>","<p>First thing in the morning, Eoin and I did our family duty and went out for croissants. It&#x2019;s a ritual we started in Barcelona a couple of years earlier. One or other of the boys will accompany their father to the nearest <em>boulangerie</em> to purchase breakfast. They&#x2019;re never far away, good bakeries, and compared to Australia or Ireland are good value. What&#x2019;s more, we usually only need to buy three croissants since a fourth is often thrown in for free. If not, well, Alexander was more a <em>pain au chocolate</em> - sorry, <em>chocolatine</em> (you don&#x2019;t want to make that <em>faux pas</em> down south, where they use the latter term) - man anyway. Eoin and I quickly located a <em>boulanger artisanal</em> just off <em>Rue Fran&#xE7;ois 1er</em>. Over breakfast, we planned the day&#x2019;s itinerary, which was concentrated around the famous Pont du Gard, the famous two-thousand year old aqueduct.</p>","<p>The fact that it takes the B31 bus around an hour to get from N&#xEE;mes to the Pont gives you an idea of the sheer scale of the project undertaken by the Roman engineers when they decided to channel water from the source they located near Uz&#xE8;s over the Gardon river and on to the settlement of Nemausus (N&#xEE;mes) which badly needed a supply for its numerous public facilities, such as the Temple of Diana fountains complex, and its bathhouses and latrines. Some private homes even got connected. And the Pont is only about halfway to Uz&#xE8;s. Following the contours of hills and mountains, and in some cases through those very mountains, the channel wound its watery way, allowing its liquid gold to drop, never so fast that it built up too much speed and damaged the water-proof concrete walls, until it reached the Gardon river valley where it was raised some fifty metres above the river by means of a tri-level aqueduct, still standing all these years later despite the complete lack of mortar in the structure, even in the arches. For over four hundred years, the water travelled, taking over a full day to flow from source to destination.</p>","<p>Alexander and Eoin found the Gardon&#x2019;s waters a bit too cold for their sensitivities, but Tina and I floated there in the river, looking up at this two-millennia old wonder as people paddled by in blue kayaks. There were plenty of daytrippers walking around on the Pont, but of course, unlike the traders crisscrossing Gaul during the late Roman period, they no longer have to imperil themselves by crossing up top since the lower level was widened in the 18th century. In fact, only its function as a foot bridge saved the entire edifice from being plundered for its masonry, a fate that befell much of the rest of the waterway.</p>","<p>On the way back to the bus I noticed a sign by an ancient <em>olivier</em> (an olive tree, not a Shakespearean thespian): <em>Je suis n&#xE9; en l&#x2019;an 908!</em> A 1108-year old living thing: now you had my attention. It was five metres in circumference at the trunk and had had space reverentially cleared around it. Moved there in 1988 from a <em>vallee aride et froide</em> by the Conseil G&#xE9;n&#xE9;ral du Gard who had been &#x2018;<em>passion&#xE9;e par mon age et mon histoire&#x2019;</em>, it reminded me of the olive trees surrounding Koukla House through which I had walked Alexander and Eoin to school on spring mornings a full year ago. &#x2018;<em>Je suis fier de participer au decor prestigieux et naturel du Pont du Gard</em>,&#x2019; the old <em>olivier</em> proudly announced.</p>","<hr>","<p>Apart from the hurried stop-off at Carcassonne en route to the Gorges du Tarn region at Easter, we hadn&#x2019;t had a chance on that particular trip to have a good scout around a decent-sized French city, one of life&#x2019;s great pleasures. Exploring N&#xEE;mes over the next couple of days we saw a lot of buildings with those pale green volets, the wooden, frequently rickety-looking window shutters so emblematic of France. Alexander and Eoin were treated to a tour of <em>Les Ar&#xE8;nes</em> (incidentally, it wasn&#x2019;t until I started learning Spanish that I found out that the word &#x2018;arena&#x2019; is the Spanish for &#x2018;sand&#x2019;.) Built at the end of the 1st century AD, and still solid after all these years, it was laid dry with very close-fitting fine-grained whitish-grey Barutel limestone from local quarries. Punters went there to see your common-or-garden gladiator fights and wild beast &#x2018;hunts&#x2019;. All this I learned from the posters outside. Alas, that was as far as I&#x2019;d get. At twenty euros an adult, I sat out the tour. Or rather, walked it off instead. Tabac shops, shops advertising <em>soldes</em> (sales), shops <em>&#xE0; louer</em> (for rent), bistros, brasseries and boulangeries, poky little shops selling nothing but <em>bandes dessin&#xE9;s</em> (graphic novels) - I absorbed the words and the racy ads in the windows, and even thrilled to the exotic abundance of smokers, certainly more than you see smoking in Brisbane (barring Chinatown). I still get a kick just strolling around a city on my own, perhaps because memories of my first ever experiences of real away-from-home travel in the Back Bay of Boston or the West End of London come flooding back. No-one knows who you are when you&#x2019;re a big-city fl&#xE2;neur, and you often have no idea what&#x2019;s around each corner. True happiness.</p>","<p>In a small square near the arena I came across a Crocodile fountain. A thought occurred to me as I gazed at the hefty stone reptile: doesn&#x2019;t the brand &#x2018;Lacoste&#x2019; have a crocodile as its emblem? Is it the same one? Is Lacoste a person&#x2019;s name, or is it a place near here? I&#x2019;d have to get to the bottom of this.</p>","<p>N&#xEE;mes is an ellipse, however, with two historical foci, the second being the Roman jewel sparkling right in the centre of the city with the rather pedestrian name of <em>La Maison Carr&#xE9;e</em>: &#x2018;The Square House&#x2019;. On a good day, such as the one I was enjoying, it gleams in the sunshine like it was built yesterday. I suppose it&#x2019;s what the Parthenon must once have looked like before the Venetians, the Turks, and Lord Elgin all had their way with it. Like the old Pont du Gard olivier, it had been reverentially set apart in its own space. It measures eleven mighty fluted columns by six, but a full third of its length is an empty portico, which you reach at the top of a broad staircase of twenty or so steps. Up on that imperial pedestal you can sit and watch N&#xEE;mes come and go.</p>","<p>Back in the shade of <em>Les Ar&#xE8;nes</em>, outside a caf&#xE9; called La Grande Bourse, I took photos of people passing by on foot or on their motos until Tina and the kids emerged. I got my twenty euros worth of information from them then. <em>Les Ar&#xE8;nes</em>, much like <em>La Maison Carr&#xE9;e</em>, had been preserved mainly because it had been used more or less continuously since the fall of the Roman empire. For much of its history it was more than just a place set aside for entertainment its currently empty interior suggests. Packed full of houses, laneways, and churches, it was a vibrant, thronging, living space for men, women, children, rats, cats, dogs, and diseases for centuries. Oh, and did I know that crocodiles were a symbol of victory over the Egyptians in the Battle of the Nile, in 47BC? Oh and furthermore, the town named Lacoste was to the east, in the Luberon region, only about fifty kilometres away. It all made sense now.</p>"],["<p>If I had to fault N&#xEE;mes in any way, I&#x2019;d point out that it wasn&#x2019;t in Provence enough. As its name strongly suggested, our next stop, Salon-de-Provence, was. Ever since I joined a French conversation group I&#x2019;d seen advertised in the caf&#xE9;s in Zakynthos last spring and had borrowed the two famous Marcel Pagnol adaptations <em>Le Ch&#xE2;teau de ma m&#xE8;re</em> and <em>La Gloire de mon p&#xE8;re</em> from their box of DVDs and watched them at night, huddled up to a heater in the front room of Koukla House after Tina and the kids had gone to bed, I&#x2019;d been dying to go to Provence. I deliberately fetishized the place, in fact. My interest went back further than that, though. If you were ever into foreign cinema, specifically French cinema, you&#x2019;ll have seen movies like <em>Jean de Florette</em> and <em>Manon des Sources</em> (both, incidentally, adapted from Pagnol novels), movies that as well as being dramatically satisfying serve to showcase <em>la belle France</em> in all its glory. In the case of those Pagnol adaptations, the wild Proven&#xE7;al countryside (with its scheming carnation growers!) is the backdrop. I mentioned the famous <em>A Year in Provence</em> in the introduction to this book: I&#x2019;d read that in preparation for this trip. Whenever Tina and I had talked about where exactly we&#x2019;d be going between Ireland and Greece I used to tell her I didn&#x2019;t care too much as long as Provence was on the itinerary. Maybe not for a year, but a week would be a decent start. What traveler wouldn&#x2019;t want to go to Provence? I said that it was deliberate, my fetishizing of Provence; what I meant is that it&#x2019;s good sometimes to pick a place and decide that come rain or shine you&#x2019;re going there. The Gorges du Tarn week had been proposed for us by the Ceoiltas gang; Poland had been suggested by Adam on the Help Exchange website; even in Australia, however, I knew we were going to go to Provence.</p>","<p>One of the first things I&#x2019;d done when we got back to Dublin was to walk four doors down from Mum&#x2019;s house to see if our French neighbour, and one-time language teacher, Annie-Claude was still in business. She wasn&#x2019;t, but said we could still do lessons anyway. So I&#x2019;d go down a couple of times a month and talk with her for an hour or so. Before we left Ireland she called up one day and presented me with an old copy of Pagnol&#x2019;s <em>Jean de Florette </em>which by this stage, as we crossed the Rh&#xF4;ne into the <em>d&#xE9;partement</em> of Provence, I was about half-way through.</p>","<p>The people we&#x2019;d arranged to stay with actually lived in the village of Pelissanne, just west of Salon-de-Provence. Eric and Marilynn lived in an old farm house, and they told us we&#x2019;d have a separate maisonette to ourselves. At the end of our drive from N&#xEE;mes, on the long driveway up to their house, we saw that our maisonette had great and heavy <em>volets, </em>and we noted with approval and relief that there was also a swimming pool on the grounds. Saint Christopher had blessed us again. It was a bit dusty inside our little house, not that we intended spending much time in there, and the toilet had a smell that neither Tina nor I could quite put our finger on. After some thought I proposed tomato soup, which Tina could neither bring herself to agree or disagree with. There were eight <em>oliviers</em> of various strains in the garden, a few cypresses, and even a couple of diseased planes which they&#x2019;d given up on. &#x201C;After two thousand euros worth of care they&#x2019;re on their own now,&#x201D; said Marilynn. What&#x2019;s more, she and Eric barely used the pool anymore. Could Alexander and Eoin use it, please, at some stage? One was in July after all. &#x201C;Mais oui,&#x201D; Eric shrugged. &#x201C;She said she wanted a pool. I said as long as you clean it&#x2026;&#x201D; What an excellent state of affairs it was to be staying with people indifferent to whether the children of complete strangers used their pool. French-kissed by fate once again! But France, July 2016, was a time for soccer, not swimming, and the boys just wanted to kick a ball around. And so Tina and I ended up being the only takers for the pool.</p>","<p>That evening while Marilynn served us <em>degustation</em>, Eric fetched plastic goals out of a shed and under their garden plane trees Ireland (Alexander) played Portugal (Eoin). Getting some olives at one stage out of their <em>frigo</em> I noticed an Irish shamrock amongst the other magnets, many from New Zealand and the US. Turned out they&#x2019;d been over to the Fair City once to visit their son who&#x2019;d been working there. It gave Tina great pleasure at that point to gift them a Great Day for a Guinness fridge magnet from our bag of paddywhackery we&#x2019;d stocked up on in O&#x2019;Carroll&#x2019;s before leaving Dublin. We discussed our plans for tomorrow with them: we were going to head into Les Alpilles, a long limestone range full of towns hidden up sides of hills by driving from nearby Salon-de-Provence to Les Baux-de-Provence, and then go to Saint-Remy-de-you-guessed-it-yep-Provence, taking the D5-de-Provence.</p>","<p>Considering Les Baux-de-Provence has given the world, or at least the English-speaking part of it, the punchy and unrhymeable word &#x2018;bauxite&#x2019;, I&#x2019;d suggest they change the name&#x2019;s suffix from the show-offy and, frankly, naff, &#x2018;de-Provence&#x2019; to something more distinct. Say it: <em>Les Baux-d&#x2019;o&#xF9;-vient-le-mot-&#x2018;bauxite&#x2019;</em>. Les Baux-from-where-the-word-Bauxite-comes. Les Baux is a village built on a bare rock between two ravines with a ruined castle on the summit. The flagstone streets twist and turn, opening up into small squares with views over the valleys below: the Val de la Fontaine (the valley of the fountain), and the more evocatively named Val d&#x2019;Enfer (the valley of hell). This dramatic and bleak valley is said to have inspired Dante&#x2019;s vision of hell in his Divine Comedy.</p>","<p>Thankfully the village is anything but hellish. The lady at the tourist information was positively angelic, giving Alexander and Eoin a treasure hunt sheet each to complete with the promise of a reward at the end. It&#x2019;s amazing the effect a quest has on people, especially young, easily manipulable ones. Having complained more or less all the way up the incline from the car park, the boys now took themselves off eagerly in search of the first clue on their sheet. In and out of tiny pseudo-museums they went, inspecting gargoyles, griffins, and stained glass icons in churches, searching for ancient troglodyte dwellings outside the old city gates, and finding seashells embedded in the castle walls. Nicely played, <em>madame du bureau d&#x2019;information touristique!</em></p>","<p>Les Baux&#x2019; strategic position meant it was settled early, both by Celts and by Romans, who quarried stone there and transported it by boat to Arles. Its heyday was in the early Middle Ages, when it was dominated by the fierce, proud, rebellious and ambitious princes of Les Baux, who controlled 79 towns and villages in the region. They claimed to be the descendants of Balthazar, one of the Three Wise Men, and the 16-pointed silver star which guided the kings to Bethlehem is still on the municipal flag. The princes of Les Baux were deposed in the 12th century, but thereafter the ch&#xE2;teau remained renowned for its elegant court, where troubadour poet-musicians practised the ornate chivalric tradition of courtly love.</p>","<p>After a lunch of cheap cr&#xEA;pes eaten in the shade of a plane tree on one of the squares, we headed up to the ch&#xE2;teau, but just like at Salzburg&#x2019;s Festung Hohensalzburg the previous year we decided against entering. It wasn&#x2019;t so much the money this time, although they were asking a hefty admission fee. The truth is we were all feeling a bit ch&#xE2;teau&#x2019;d out. We soon repented of our decision, however, when we found out that there were life-size reproductions of catapults, trebuchets and other war machines on display. Too late. Back at the bureau, the wily madame looked into Alexander&#x2019;s and Eoin&#x2019;s black souls, into their hearts of steel full of Horrible Histories and Torture Museums and saw two little kids who she knew would melt at the sight of their prizes: a <em>santon</em> each, which are small hand-painted nativity sheep terracotta figurines, produced right there in Provence, theirs to take home and place beside their halberd-toting Knights Templar figures.</p>","<p>You know you&#x2019;re suffering Roman ruin fatigue when you don&#x2019;t stop at Glanum. That and we were unwilling to stand for hours in the burning sun. We did however drive past its splendid triumphal arch as we arrived at the pretty town of Saint-R&#xE9;my-de-Provence. At a plane-shaded square we revived ourselves with water right from the fountain. The old town is fairly small and surrounded by a ring-road of boulevards. You can see the remains of the 14th-century protective wall in the old <em>portes </em>(gateways), still in use today as the entrance ways into the ancient center of old Saint-R&#xE9;my. Long, meditative all&#xE9;es of platanes reminded us of the ones Didier had shown us at Easter down at the Canal du Midi.</p>","<p>Given that Provence had some of the earliest signs of human habitation found anywhere in Europe, one can be excused for not being up on all aspects of its history. In Le Vieux-Village d&#x2019;Opp&#xE8;de (The Old Village of Opp&#xE8;de) I sat with a p&#x2019;tit caf&#xE9; on la Place de la Croix the following morning and read a pamphlet I&#x2019;d just bought in the church to at least familiarise myself with this small part of the world at the foothills of the Luberon, the mountain range from which this whole area takes its name. I read that the valley we&#x2019;d just driven in to get here was the old Via Domitia. The whole area had been occupied since the neolithic. From 1600 years before Christ the Ligures lived here (I supposed they came from Liguria, just around the corner in Italy, and which we&#x2019;d briefly visit in a couple of weeks.) Then the Celts came down the Rh&#xF4;ne valley, mingling with the inhabitants over time to create a Celto-Ligurian society. Enter the Romans. They called this part of the world Gallia Narbonensis, or Provincia Nostra, which is where the name Provence comes from. From 120BC they imposed their famous Pax Romana on the situation, which is when things quitened down a bit and people could stop hiding in caves halfway up the Luberon and start creating <em>villae</em>, agricultural domains, in the valley. Christianity arrived around the year 200; Judaism around then, too.</p>","<p>Sometimes - usually, in fact - the most interesting parts of history are the smallest ones. Before sitting down on the square we&#x2019;d walked up Opp&#xE8;de&#x2019;s restored <em>calades</em>, an old proven&#xE7;ale word for paved path/road, all the way to the top of the old village. The <em>calades</em> slope up gently, and have a step up every metre or metre and a half. You&#x2019;ve walked up a similar slope/step combination yourself if you&#x2019;ve ever been anywhere old in Europe. This arrangement, it turns out, was designed that way for the &#x201C;<em>pas d&#x2019;&#xE2;ne</em>&#x201D;: for the benefit of a donkey&#x2019;s step. When I read this, it reminded me of the old &#x201C;width of two horses&#x2019; asses&#x201D; story. You know, how the width of the solid rocket boosters for the Space Shuttles was determined by the gauge width of the railway between the factories and the launch pads, which in turn was determined by the fact that the engineers who built the railways were English originally, and had used the same tools, naturally, to build the railways in America they had used to build the tramways in Britain, the widths of which, naturally again, had to follow the ruts in the old, long distance roads built by, yes, those Romans again, whose war chariots were built to a standard size in order to accommodate two war horses&#x2019; rear ends. So the next time you wonder why they drive on the left in your country, or on the right, or some arbitrary frozen accident like that, it&#x2019;s probably down to the length of an ass&#x2019;s step or the width of a horse&#x2019;s ass.</p>","<p>That evening we were introduced to the pleasures of a <em>demi-peche</em>, which is peach syrup with a beer. We started drinking in preparation for that night&#x2019;s big game.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Vous aimez les radis?</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>Radishes? Beer and radishes. Peach beer and radishes. Beer and peachey radishes and horse&#x2019;s asses on the Via Domitia. I was half drunk before the semi-final against Germany even started. When Griezmann put Les Bleus in the lead from the penalty spot just before half-time Eric broke out the champagne. When Griezmann got his second Eric broke out the cow horn. <em>Allez les bleues!</em></p>"],["<p>&#x201C;Howay, man!&#x201D;</p>","<p>Mike the builder met us at Orange train station. Short, stocky, and bald, he looked like a builder. He helped us put our stuff in the boot of a once fancy BMW. A builder&#x2019;s beamer.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Good trip?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh yes, indeed.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ready to do some work? Only joking &#x2013; you can settle in tonight, and we&#x2019;ll crack on tomorrow. Debbie and Jason are away for a couple of days.&#x201D;</p>","<p>It was Debbie &#x2013; the actual owner of the house (with husband Jason) - we&#x2019;d been writing to online. She&#x2019;d mentioned Mike would be the one we&#x2019;d be dealing with on a day-to-day basis. He&#x2019;d persuaded them that in order to realise their dream of having a house in the Proven&#xE7;al woods they&#x2019;d need more hands. He himself hailed from somewhere in the north of England, up around <em>Auf Wiedersehen, Pet</em> country if I wasn&#x2019;t too far off.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Aye - I&#x2019;m from Newcastle.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;A Geordie.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Aye.&#x201D;</p>","<p>He drove us through the centre of Orange, giving us a first glimpse of the walls of the ancient Roman theatre, the Th&#xE9;&#xE2;tre Antique d&#x2019;Orange, around which the town seemed to crowd as if to freely avail of the music from the classical and opera performances that spill out into the caf&#xE9;s at festival time, which was around this time of year. Orange is a UNESCO World Heritage town on the western edge of the Provence-Alpes-C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Azur region, a town I knew little about but one which, being Irish, it turned out I should have known something about. A few streets on we passed a solid, sturdy Arc de Triomphe, also Roman-era. Triple-arched and top-heavy like a cartoon bully, it was first built, apparently, in honour of the veterans of the Gallic wars during the reign of Augustus, then later reconstructed by Tiberius in honour of the victories by Germanicus over the German tribes. Whereas at one time it was part of the walls of the town, nowadays it was in the middle of a large traffic island on the outskirts.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Remember that arch. It&#x2019;ll come in handy for getting picked up if you want a lift into town this week.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I wish the suburbs we lived in at home had an Arc de Triomphe amongst all the bottle shops and massage joints.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Considering where Mike was from, arguably the part of the world least likely to produce French speakers (says the Irishman living in Brisbane), I began to think that for this stay we mightn&#x2019;t end up conducting much of our business in French. I said something vaguely French to him to test the water.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Sorry man, I don&#x2019;t speak any French. But there&#x2019;s plenty of French around as do.&#x201D;</p>","<p>For about fifteen minutes we drove north, fields of wheat and sunflowers in bloom on our right and left. At a point where the countryside began to become more wooded we turned into a private property with a signpost saying &#x2018;Le Moulin&#x2019; - The Mill. A couple of hundred metres down a heavily wooded laneway we stopped at what seemed like a builders&#x2019; yard in front of a handsome old two-storey <em>mas</em> that looked like it was in the process of getting a facelift. We alighted from the beamer and stood there, looking up at the old girl with her fine stone work and <em>volets</em> and thought: this is it. This is the <em>Year in Provence</em> dream. An old millhouse in the woods in Provence. There were stairs down to a lower level garden in front of the house where a stream that wound around the back (that must have fed the mill in the old days) pooled to admire itself before flitting off kittenishly. I caught Tina&#x2019;s eye: even if the work turned out to be hard this next ten days the setting would surely make up for it.</p>","<p>Mike showed us to our quarters, a dusty, dank room on the top floor right at the back of the house whose walls, composed of rough-hewn computer-sized stones, looked like they might not have been improved in the three-hundred years that the house had been in existence. There was a thick wooden beam that traversed the room at face height, handy for drying towels and concussion.</p>","<p>We reconvened out front in the patio to take the evening air. Oh, but we&#x2019;d played our cards nicely ending up with this hand, I thought to myself, watching the boys charge around after the house Labrador. But we&#x2019;d nearly had to fold early. During the initial negotiations a month or two earlier on the Help Exchange website, Debbie had let slip (after a couple of messages had been sent back and forth and we&#x2019;d begun looking forward to this particular stay) that her husband, Jason, wasn&#x2019;t wild about having people stay, but, hey, not to worry &#x2013; it&#x2019;d be Mike the builder we&#x2019;d be working with. Hmmm, I thought. Tina felt the same. Hmmmm. Who wants to be an unwanted guest in someone&#x2019;s house, lavender-scented evenings or no lavender-scented evenings? Put out, I wrote back to her to say that either we were welcome or we weren&#x2019;t, and that we had no desire to importune anyone who didn&#x2019;t want us there. What was more, I assured her, we had plenty of options available to us. Good <em>day</em>, Madam! &#x201C;Well, that&#x2019;s the end of that,&#x201D; I said to Tina. &#x201C;What else have we got?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Nothing.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;What about the English woman running historical tours down near Carcassonne? She sounded interesting.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Yeah, maybe. We have a Skype session with her today.&#x201D;</p>","<p>It turned out that the English woman running historical tours down near Carcassonne expected helpers to do six hours a day, six days a week. Evidently she aimed to recreate the conditions of medieval feudal life for her helpers as well as in her historical tours.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh well. Has Noel&#x2019;s friend written back?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Of course not.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;And the woman with the, thing&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Accordeon.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;..up in&#x2026;?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Clermont-Ferrand.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Yep!&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Nope.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Yes, despite the wealth of splendid options available to us, we were really disappointed that the Debbie thing had fallen through.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m glad we found out in advance we were going to be <em>personae non gratae</em>.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Can you say that? <em>Personae</em>? <em>Gratae</em>?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I believe so, yes.&#x201D;</p>","<p>As important as intra-familial harmony was, the inter-familial variety was more so. After all, we could arrive at someone&#x2019;s door mad at each other after the strains of a hard day&#x2019;s travel - and probably had - but we could always hide it. If you didn&#x2019;t get on with your hosts, however, it&#x2019;d just be brutally awkward, like taking your Dad to a topless bar, or something. And rural situations deserved special attention. You can&#x2019;t just walk away from a house in the woods they way we&#x2019;d been able to get away from Tom&#x2019;s, back in Budapest. No one wants to make a dramatic exit only to get chased up a tree by a stoat.</p>","<p>But much to my amazement, and even more to her credit, Debbie had written back to clarify that all she&#x2019;d meant was that Jason had recently suffered a hellish gallstones episode and was still feeling a bit weak. They all looked forward to meeting us. She even apologised. I felt a rollercoaster of emotions: first, regret for my haughtiness. Secondly, amazement that we had managed to get this far into our trip without resorting to haughtiness. Considering the results, haughtiness was now an arrow in our quiver. Third, relief. In fact we could have wept for relief right there in Mum&#x2019;s front room back in May - our control centre; our Houston - to have locked in that week and a half. But now there we were at the mill and they were nowhere to be seen.</p>","<p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;ll probably be back the day after tomorrow. They&#x2019;re really nice, you&#x2019;ll see,&#x201D; Mike assured us. We had no doubt they were nice, but food was nice too. We had kids to feed. When we realised, sitting out there on the patio, that the only thing Mike was going to cook up was another tin of Red Stripe, we wandered into the kitchen and helped ourselves. Always a tricky part of any stay, working out exactly how free you can be with a host&#x2019;s kitchen and food, but man cannot live on Red Stripe alone, although in fairness Mike was giving it a decent shot.</p>","<p>After Tina had put Alexander and Eoin to bed and gone up herself, I ended up chatting with Mike till midnight. We talked about astronomy and physics and cosmology, branching whimsically into subjects as diverse as the accents of England and Ireland and memorable football semi-finals. Around ten the Mistral kicked up. There were no proverbial donkeys around whose ears might be blown off, but we did take in the umbrellas. Back at the patio table in the pitch black, well Striped at this stage, the conversation stumbled towards its natural endpoint: Einsteinian relativity and spacetime curvature. We got some good work done there. The stream chuckled at us below. The stars beamed down at us through curved space. I&#x2019;m going to like it here, I thought.</p>","<p>Tina and I reported for work at eight the next morning. That bloody beam! I must have banged my head on it in the middle of the night. The main downstairs room was being retiled, and we were going to learn about tiling. It quickly became apparent to both of us that this particular experience was going to be a little bit more industrial than the French-verbs-and-leave-out-the-recycling types of experience we&#x2019;d had thus far. Half a mountain&#x2019;s worth of sepia-coloured local stone tiles with beautiful swirls, authentically imperfect to the millimetre, had been piled high in the yard. Job number one for me was to find the ones that were more or less intact &#x2013; the ones that had not had their corners broken off - and to measure off with a chunky builder&#x2019;s pencil the dimensions on each that Mike had given me. Easy enough. Job number two was to mix up some grout. This is where things started to get a little bit filthy.</p>","<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll need to wash out a couple of buckets first. Just go down to t&#x2019;stream.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Kneeling at the edge of t&#x2019;river, I allowed the cold water to slowly fill t&#x2019;bucket and started sloshing out the dirt at t&#x2019;bottom. We&#x2019;d found a map that told us this stream had a name, albeit one which only French people could pronounce without descending into foolishness: <em>Le Riou</em>. I left my hand in the water, thinking of the life-giving stream Manon had blocked in the movie, thinking of the lack of rivers and streams in Zakynthos, thinking of the Shannon flooding at Christmas and forcing us to drive all around Mayo to get home&#x2026;</p>","<p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t have to be that clean, man,&#x201D; said Mike, standing over me with a smoke.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh, sorry. It&#x2019;s nice here.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;If you follow the river down a couple of hundred yards there&#x2019;s the ruins of a house where a groundskeeper lived. According to legend he got a bad case of gold fever and blew the place up with dynamite looking for the stuff.&#x201D;</p>","<p>We both looked downstream and saw nothing but the stream slipping into the crowd of trees.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s crack on,&#x201D; Mike said, dropping his fag end into his cuppa with a sizzle.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Aye. I mean, ok.&#x201D;</p>","<p>For four hours we cracked on - me mixing grout and carrying tiles over for Mike to cut with the wet saw, and Tina on her hands and knees slotting the neatly cut tiles into empty spaces on the floor and filling in the gaps with my grout. Mixing grout (in case you don&#x2019;t know) entails emptying bags of grout powder into a bucket, pouring water in, and then applying a Black &amp; Decker power mixer to the situation with your mouth closed. We did all this listening to the &#x2018;tradio&#x2019;. Well, that&#x2019;s what Tina called it. In Australia, people who work in the construction business, or do any form of physical work, are called &#x2018;tradies&#x2019;, which comes from &#x2018;tradesman&#x2019;. You also get &#x2018;chippies&#x2019;, &#x2018;firies&#x2019;, &#x2018;sparkies&#x2019;, and &#x2018;garbos&#x2019;. I guess that made me a &#x2018;groutie&#x2019;. So when tradies put on the radio to while away the hours it&#x2019;s called the &#x2018;tradio&#x2019;. Get it? The &#x2018;tradio&#x2019;. Mike had his own lingo that we had to adjust to too. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m just gannin&#x2019; to t&#x2019;netty,&#x201D; he said at one stage before ganning to the netty. &#x201C;I think he&#x2019;s fecked off to the jacks,&#x201D; I said Tina. &#x201C;I wish he&#x2019;d speak normally.&#x201D; When we said we were just going to check on the boys, he&#x2019;d say &#x201C;Nee grief, man.&#x201D; Sure if I wasn&#x2019;t going to learn any French on this leg at least I&#x2019;d learn some Aussie and Geordie slang.</p>","<p>Despite having to go to work, I always woke up happy in Le Moulin. There was satisfaction in this work, and Mike was good to work with. We always knew what we had to do. We did our four hours, and that was that. We actually felt like we were helping, too. One fine morning we gardened, weeding around the lavender. It was hard work but I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;ve ever weeded with such a light hand. We could hardly see the house, we were that far away from things. In fact, the only sign of civilisation was a plank across a stream. Another morning we had to clean out one of the three large cylindrical caves that ran the length of the mill directly underneath it. By this stage, the kids were sufficiently bored to be keen to actually help out, so Eoin and I got to it like men. We had to group the building supplies &#x2013; pipes, bricks, planks, taps, u-bends, chicken wire. But there were also boxes of old books. Debbie and Jason had inherited, it seemed, a lifetime&#x2019;s clutter when they&#x2019;d bought this place. It was like a bomb hit a museum. Things that we were somewhat familiar with but which the boys would probably never experience were everywhere - music albums, delph and crockery, porno mags (<em>Lui</em>) with models who actually had pubic hair, childrens&#x2019; toys made of wood, or worse: iron! I even came across a sheet of plywood on which a juvenile boar had died and been pressed flat by time, only the tusks curling out to transcend its two-dimensional death-space. Another morning we dragged so many beehives out of there it took us our full quota of four hours just to break them to bits.</p>","<p>Debbie and Jason themselves turned up after a few days with their young kids, happily enough around the same vintage as ours. Her parents were due in from Spain the following day. A grown daughter, product of one or other of their earlier marriages, arrived the day after that. Jason was a tall, serious-looking fella with a soft Australian accent who seemed to busy himself most of the time in their home office - they ran an online training business - , while Debbie, a slim, blonde Welsh lass, would take much more of a hands-on role with the front room tiling. Jason didn&#x2019;t socialise much with us in the evenings but Debbie seemed genuinely interested in our trip: where we&#x2019;d been, what we&#x2019;d done, all that. For the evenings she was actually there, we all sat in the front room watching TV, having throughly swept with our hands any surface we planned to sit on or rest our cuppa on. On the nights she wasn&#x2019;t there Mike became the de facto host and the program for the evening&#x2019;s entertainment ran more to <em>American Sniper</em> and Marvel movies. When he wasn&#x2019;t staying over at the mill he lived in an apartment in Orange, and drove us one day into town after we&#x2019;d finished for the day.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be in the Caf&#xE9; du Th&#xE9;&#xE2;tre (he hadn&#x2019;t actually said that, but we worked out that that was what he meant) if you want to come and have a scoop later on.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Orange wasn&#x2019;t nearly as big as N&#xEE;mes &#x2013; we knocked it off in an hour or so - but there was a fine statue of Rimbaud II, Comte d&#x2019;Orange, with &#x2018;Vainqueur &#xE0; Antioche et &#xE0; Jerusalem en MXCIX&#x2019; on it, and the boys did find a Magic the Gathering shop. That was their thing around then - Magic is a card-trading game with echoes of Dungeons and Dragons that they&#x2019;d gotten into. There were a scattering of young guys at a few tables playing at the back of the shop. As soon as we bought the usual couple of booster packs for the boys, a few of the guys came and stood around us to see what cards the boys had gotten.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Oh, c&#x2019;est cool, &#xE7;a.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Ouai, c&#x2019;est vraiment supercool, cette carte.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>But that small <em>goutte</em> of French was all I was going to get there in Orange. For when it came to speaking French, I felt like Fernando Rey&#x2019;s Mathieu in <em>That Obscure Object of Desire (</em>Luis Bu&#xF1;uel&#x2019;s last ever film), endlessly frustrated in his attempt to achieve his goal. Which was, of course, to have his way with Conchita; mine, the more wholesome wish, reasonable under the circumstances, one would have thought, to improve my French by speaking it in a bar in France. <em>Helas! </em>Mike, as we knew, spoke nary a word of French. His friends patiently worked around that by speaking English. Still, we were out and about, drinking like locals: &#x201C;<em>Deux demi-peches, s&#x2019;il vous plait.</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>In the evening, with the morning&#x2019;s splinters and dust still in my hair and a <em>bi&#xE8;re</em> buzz to keep me from caring, I read about Orange while the boys and Tina played Magic. The 1688&#x2013;1691 Williamite-Jacobite War, in which the Dutch-born King of England, William III, defeated the armies of the Catholic King James II, was a watershed event in the history of Ireland. William was known by the title Prince of Orange, having inherited the principality of the Roman town we&#x2019;d just come back from from his father, William the Silent. At the time Orange was a fief of the Holy Roman Empire (It is a happy fact that wherever you are in western Europe, you are probably standing in what was, at one time or another, a fief). In particular the victory of William, Prince of Orange, over the Continental Jacobite forces at the Battle of the Boyne is what protestants in Northern Ireland commemorate by wearing orange. We&#x2019;d crossed the river Boyne a couple of months earlier on our trip up to Northern Ireland, and had actually walked its banks a month or two later on a day trip to Newgrange during which we&#x2019;d also visited the site of the Battle of the Boyne. I hadn&#x2019;t realised at the time that there existed a town in the south of France we&#x2019;d be in in a matter of a few months whose name gave colour to the awful history of my country.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Dad, there&#x2019;s a scorpion.&#x201D;</p>","<p>The first scorpion any of us had ever seen, evilly black and only about an inch long, was quickly corralled in a plastic sandwich case and put outside.</p>","<p>After about a week or so we still considered this sort of place to be the stuff of retirement fantasies. The lavender, the cedars, the tranquil ocean of pine and scrub oak harbouring boars and scorpions - it all appealed to us greatly. If we lived here we&#x2019;d go and see Aida at the annual New Chor&#xE9;gies festival at the ancient theatre, clinking our glasses together while some opera snob shushed us. We&#x2019;d get our daily bread from the tiny nearby village of Uchaux and go for day trips to Aix to see the galleries and climb Cezanne&#x2019;s Mont St. Victoire. Oh, the labours of Hercules it may well have needed just to keep entropy at bay, but having grouted and weeded the dream, to us it was still a dream. Unlike Debbie, though, we would have picked our fights more judiciously. The tiles that had been taken up in the room we were tiling and placed in a heap looked fine to us. Debbie just didn&#x2019;t like them. In fact, she didn&#x2019;t like much about the place, it seemed. She openly admitted, in fact, having owned it a couple of years by that stage, that they were just doing what was necessary to get it up to a standard where they could sell it again. The thing is, they weren&#x2019;t the slightest bit interested in the culture that surrounded them. We never got the sense that they were committing to the country. They felt frustrated to still be denied permission for the pool they wanted to sink in the garden. In the interim they had erected a raised pool, with stepladder access. Doubtless it was a relief in the middle of the summer, but &#x2013; how to put it? - it looked a bit <em>merde</em>. Unlike, say, some of the people we met in Zakynthos, who immersed themselves, almost to a fault, in the culture, here they were really only skimming along the surface.</p>","<p>It didn&#x2019;t help that the rest of their extended family didn&#x2019;t think having a house in the woods was such a great idea. Certainly not the grown daughter who flew in from LA and took off again after only a day. Nor Debbie&#x2019;s elderly parents, who&#x2019;d driven up from Spain, where they were perfectly happy, <em>muchas gracias</em>. The Dad was somewhat senile, and they&#x2019;d discovered that senility and living deep in the woods went together like Laurel and Hardy. He&#x2019;d actually won a medal as a young man for jumping into rough seas to save someone from drowning. Now he was the one who needed saving. If not constantly monitored he was in the habit of wandering off and disappearing, triggering a full-scale alert. In fact, on one of the days we were grouting, pencilling, kneeling, tiling and sweeping up, the family went for a day trip to Aix only to have the day ruined when they lost him and took most of the day to find him again. No, none of them liked it. They all sardonically called it &#x2018;the Island&#x201D;; not in the island paradise sense, but rather in the isolated,-and-hard-to-get-to sense. And sadly, no real connection was made between our kids and theirs. In fact, after a few days there was talk, in our camp at least, of downright hostilities. This would be the only place where Al and Eoin didn&#x2019;t gel with the other kids. We put that down to the fact that they were all left unsupervised in front of a TV and games console, with minimal supervision.</p>","<p>Like I say, Jason was always preoccupied with their business and as a result never really connected with us, but for all that was never less than polite and gentlemanly. Lacking a car, we were at his, Mike&#x2019;s and Debbie&#x2019;s mercy. But he did drive us into Avignon one fine morning, coming in on a tributary of the Rhone, to give us one one of our most memorable days out yet. We spent hours in the Pope&#x2019;s Palace, and afterwards enjoyed being accosted by bewigged and berouged students handing out colourful flyers and merch for this production of <em>Monsieur Mouche</em> or that performance of <em>Volpone</em> for the current theatre festival.</p>","<p>The morning before Bastille Day, the 14th of July, President Hollande announced that the national state of emergency, put in place after the November 2015 Paris attacks, would end after the 2016 Tour de France finished on 26 July 2016. The very next day a jihadist killed 86 people with a truck at the celebrations on the Nice beachfront. Despite being on the western edge of Provence we wrote home to Mum to let her know we hadn&#x2019;t slipped over to Nice, on the eastern edge, for the day that was in it. You know how Mums worry.</p>","<p>Debbie and Jason flew back to London for a party the day after that, and that was the last we saw of them. We left a few days after that. In the event, the only person I&#x2019;d managed to speak any French with was the baker in Uchaux which we used to walk to for baguettes on days we didn&#x2019;t have a lift to Orange or Avignon.</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Australie? C&#x2019;est tres loin, ca!</em>&#x201D;</p>","<p>Mike dropped us into the Arc de Triomphe on our last morning where we were picked up by a businessman in pharmaceuticals who drove to Aix once a week with an otherwise empty, shiny, black, brand-new Mercedes-Benz, and so offered lifts on BlaBlaCar, the ride share service popular in these parts. I got to practice my French and gave him five stars.</p>"]]},{"index":16,"title":"A lesson in Lessona","pages":[["<p>A few days of r&#x2019;n&#x2019;r in Aix-en-Provence and Turin would do us the world of good before taking up our next (and final of this entire trip) work exchange. If I didn&#x2019;t see another bag of grout powder for a while I&#x2019;d be fine with that. And Tina&#x2019;s knees needed a break from all that crawling around laying that grout. For the next few days we were going to put our faith in the restorative power of art.</p>","<p>Other than Van Gogh&#x2019;s <em>Sunflowers</em> in the National Gallery of London and some Russborough House Caravaggios in Dublin we hadn&#x2019;t taken in much modern art so far on our trip. Alexander and Eoin had sensibly remained unimpressed with their only exposure to pop art, in Vienna&#x2019;s mumok, where you had to read a long-winded exegesis to make sense of each high-concept video installation which was usually of someone defecating on a flag or something. No, it seemed the boys were traditionalists. We wondered what they&#x2019;d make of the gaudy daubs and splashes of impressionism, now we were in the south of France.</p>","<p>There is a quarry at a place called Bibemus, just outside Aix, from where the artist Paul C&#xE9;zanne painted Mont St. Victoire, over and over again. There, not only would the kids (and we) get to learn something about the artist who bridged the 19th and 20th centuries, from impressionism to cubism, we&#x2019;d also get out into the <em>paysage</em>. But in the event the weather and the general skittishness about terrorism - one, or the other, or both - conspired to prevent us doing that, for somewhere in the woods, heading west out of Aix, we found the road closed and our early morning minibus tour over before it began. Fire precautions, said the guide, then threw in some stuff about official nervousness, what with all the attacks in Nice, etc. That was just silly, I thought, and told him so. &#x201C;<em>Ah bon?</em>&#x201D; he shrugged.</p>","<p>In the famous Les Deux Gar&#xE7;ons caf&#xE9; we regrouped with our own <em>deux gar&#xE7;ons </em>and had another brainwave: we&#x2019;d get the bus down to Marseille. They were bound to have some art there. Further investigations indeed revealed that France&#x2019;s second city might have been crumbling with neglect and dotted, like a pointillist painting, with areas you wouldn&#x2019;t want to wander into, but it did have a new, high-profile waterfront site called the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations, aka MuCEM, built on reclaimed land next to an old fort, in which, luckily for us, there was a Picasso show on at that very moment. MuCEM was so new, in fact, that if it was a human it would be distinctly uncivilized, given to tantrums and not sharing things with its brother. It turned out to be well worth it: a sleek, modern oddity on the shores of the Mediterranean in which we took in an exhibition of the great Spaniard&#x2019;s bull sculptures and ceramics.</p>","<p>Before getting the Metro back to the bus station for Aix late in the afternoon we stopped off for a Ricard at a bar called <em>Le Vieux Port</em>, which as its name suggests was right by the water. The day&#x2019;s business was done. We had argued earlier about whether it was worth queuing up for a boat ride to the &#xCE;les du Frioul, a pair of low, rocky outcrops a few kilometres out into the bay, but Tina had prevailed, and she&#x2019;d been right. I&#x2019;d been ready to just give up on the crowds but I had to admit later on it was nice to be able to say we&#x2019;d sailed past the famous Ch&#xE2;teau d&#x2019;If, the setting for <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>, before landing on our first French island and having a swim. Gone now were the crowds milling around the ticket office. Gone, too, was the sun, nearly. Sitting there at <em>Le Vieux Port</em> with sea salt still on my lips, my thoughts began to turn to the recent riots in the city which like most people I&#x2019;d seen on the news on TV. The running battles between the Russian and English fans we&#x2019;d seen back in Mum&#x2019;s about a month earlier must have taken place very close to where we were having our sundowner. The Euros themselves were over a good week at that stage, but I became morbidly curious, now that I&#x2019;d spent the day walking around Marseille, to see exactly where the trouble had been. When we got home I looked for videos of the fighting and was shocked to see one skirmish take place right where we&#x2019;d been sitting at <em>Le Vieux Port</em>. In the video I watched as &#x2018;fans&#x2019;, standing at the exact spot we&#x2019;d had our drink throw the chairs we&#x2019;d been sitting on at each other. Was that why the bar owner had been a little curt and aloof with us? One could hardly blame him. He probably didn&#x2019;t want to see another tourist for a long time. From the Bataclan attacks in November to the recent Nice waterfront rampage and the hooliganism here in Marseille, we felt a little relieved to be leaving France, blighted as it seemed to be for the time being with insecurity.</p>","<hr>","<p>We stormed Italy by train, coming through the Alps from Lyon, and stayed in Turin, <em>la citt&#xE0; dell&#x2019;automobile</em>, for a couple of nights. Even allowing for our Aix interlude, it still felt a treat to be in a clean, touristy room. It felt even better to be mothered again, at least for the ten or so minutes we spent with the mother of the woman who owned the flat we arrived in late in the evening. She had a plate of little almondy treats called Amaretti di Mombaruzzo for us, and made light work of the fact that we didn&#x2019;t speak each others&#x2019; languages by conducting herself in the bustling, commanding manner of an Italian mamma. We were staying in a district just outside the centre, full of five or six story buildings with ornate window sculptures. Our place had those nice big European doors, the ones with vertical circular iron locks that turn with a rotation of the handle. I&#x2019;d had no idea how much I&#x2019;d been missing those big tall European doors all those years in Australia.</p>","<p>Turin was the start of three weeks in Piedmont, most of which we&#x2019;d planned to spend in a B&amp;B in a small town called Lessona, not as guests, but workers: our last work exchange. Depending on how we got on there, we planned to at least see some of Milan and the surrounds. In the meantime we investigated Turin. On a street called Via Po, full of what the French called <em>bouquinistes</em> - the lock-up stalls where they sell second hand books - I bought a copy of Umberto Eco&#x2019;s <em>Foucault&#x2019;s Pendulum</em> in Italian.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, that was a waste of &#x20AC;13,&#x201D; said Tina. &#x201C;You couldn&#x2019;t finish it in English. Twice. What a lightweight.&#x201D;</p>","<p>How I regretted confiding in her. &#x201C;Excuse me,&#x201D; I retorted. &#x201C;But I prefer the term <em>dilettante</em>.&#x201D; The truth was, though, my reading career was like a fridge with a couple of half-empty jars at the back with the labels <em>Moby Dick</em> and <em>Ulysses</em> that I needed to either finish or throw out. I was a lightweight with nothing except the unearned conviction that this time I was going to read <em>Il Pendolo di Foucault</em>. Oh, she&#x2019;d see. The momentum of being in Italy, of having seen an actual pendulum in Frombork. Of having been in Tomar in December, easily the most mysterious of months: it was all just a question of momentum. Newton&#x2019;s First Law of Reading: a body will continue reading a book unless acted upon by another book, or by Netflix. Well, we didn&#x2019;t have Netflix here. Yes, to hesitate was to fail. I started reading <em>Il Pendolo</em> that evening. &#x201C;Something something, something, 1315AD &#x2026; Paris something something&#x2026;&#x201D; It looked promising; my cup of tea. &#x201C;Something something something something something something,&#x201D; he went on, &#x201C;Then something something something the Templars something into something.&#x201D; After an exhausting two paragraphs I put the book down and fell into foggy dreams of medieval, knight-like figures floating over the landcape like ghosts.</p>","<p>Almost from the first moment we&#x2019;d set foot in Italy, we&#x2019;d felt a stylishness in the air. We both distinctly felt we should dress better. Tina had often said she wanted us to dress a little less like a pair of dags, as they say in Australia, although it&#x2019;s hard when you&#x2019;re travelling, of course. In a menswear shop on Via Garibaldi called Uomo an impeccably turned-out <em>uomo</em> sold me a light, Italian blue cotton pullover. Project <em>Bella Figura</em> had started.</p>","<p>I began to walk more stylishly. Just because we were tourists didn&#x2019;t mean we couldn&#x2019;t flaunt it. In Piazza Castello a guy in a gorilla suit was wandering around near the water sprinklers, and having spotted Alexander and Eoin grabbed them and encouraged me to take a photo. I got the camera out. &#x201C;Heyyy, smile. Alexander, smile.&#x201D; The camera wouldn&#x2019;t turn on. That&#x2019;s funny: I&#x2019;d charged the battery only this morning. I know I had. I opened up the battery compartment: empty. I&#x2019;d forgotten to put it back in. Alexander and Eoin and the gorilla were watching me. It was hard to tell what the gorilla guy was thinking, but Alexander and Eoin were definitely mortified. I shrugged at the gorilla guy. He shrugged back and released the boys from his hold. They walked back to me, partially mortified, partially relieved. The gorilla guy waved at them sadly; well, neutrally, I suppose. I&#x2019;m projecting here: I don&#x2019;t really know how he felt. We walked away, and the gorilla guy walked away and took off his head. He was a muscular type - I suppose that helps -, with hardly any hair - I suppose that helps too. I felt bad. I should have just pretended to take the picture. When will I learn? Cameras are as much for making people feel good as they are for actually capturing images.</p>","<p>Through the Piazza Reale we went then. The black and white patterned pebbles in the courtyard reminded me of that morning, half a year ago, in Pra&#xE7;a de Rep&#xFA;blica, Tomar. We stood where Charlie Croker stood in <em>The Italian Job</em> &#x2013; which we made sure to watch with the boys as soon as we got back to Australia. Yes, the original. What sort of a parent do you think I am?</p>","<p>After a couple of weeks in France, with its familiar-sounding street names and words, I was loving the names of the streets here. For example, to get into the centro, we had to cross Corso Principe Oddoni before traversing Piazza Statuto. We would say the names out loud to ourselves. Italian is a musical language, and if you want to hear the music sometimes you have to do your own singing. In a lane off Statuto called La Porta Rossa - sing it! - we had the best pizza of the trip, the best of our lives, I&#x2019;d say, in a place called Gennaro Esposito, which had black and white pictures of an old-style Italian comedian called Tot&#xF2; all over the walls. We&#x2019;d never heard of him, so I looked him up when I got home and got this gem of a quote from Eco: &#x201C;In this globalized world where it seems that everyone sees the same movies and eats the same food, there are still unbridgeable divisions between cultures. How can two peoples ever come to understand each other when one of them is ignorant of Tot&#xF2;?&quot; We were a little bit closer to understanding Italians now.</p>"],["<p>In Lessona our luck ran out. The three-and-a-half-week stay we&#x2019;d arranged on Help Exchange to stay in Laura&#x2019;s attractive-looking B&amp;B in northern Piedmont didn&#x2019;t work out. It didn&#x2019;t work out for either us or her, actually. And like a couple who&#x2019;d long since grown tired of each others&#x2019; faces we would deny it till we were all forced to admit it.</p>","<p>We arrived in Cossato, the medium-sized town that serves as the gateway to Lessona, at least as far as train passengers are concerned, on a muggy afternoon in early July on a line, I was pleased to note later, that skirted the <em>Parco Nazionale Gran Paradiso</em> in the western Alps, not that we saw much of it.</p>","<p>The station at Cossato was so small that on alighting from the train one had to walk back across the tracks to exit the station. We were in the sticks now. Laura was waiting for us in the car park. She warmly welcomed us to her part of Italy but seemed not to have combed her hair since the get-to-know-you Skype session we&#x2019;d done together a month or so beforehand. Given that we hadn&#x2019;t spoken to her since that Skype session we went over again the confusing matter of our provenances.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, we live in Australia, but Tina&#x2019;s parents are from Greece, and I&#x2019;m Irish.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;What is marrish?&#x201D;</p>","<p>That Skype session should have been a red flag. We&#x2019;d struggled to make sense of each other, she and I, since on a scale from one to ten her English was rough as a badger&#x2019;s arse. Our Italian was even rougher. She claimed to be learning English, though, and had said she wanted us to help her improve. Desperate for options, we had discovered on that call that we both spoke Spanish, me and her, better than we spoke each others&#x2019; languages, funnily enough, so we switched pronto. Things improved slightly, but what were Tina and the kids going to do when we got to Lessona - use me as an interpreter each time they wanted to talk to the woman of the house? This sort of nonsense is precisely why you do a preliminary Skype session with a prospective work exchange host. You want to discover things about each other like the fact that you can barely communicate so you can call a halt to proceedings early on if necessary. Funny how a whiff of the alpine slopes, though, makes you forget that simple fact. And by May, as the continent was gearing up for the Euro Championships, we&#x2019;d been juggling couchsurfs, work exchanges, and airbnbs; two nights here, three there, one in-between; and the flights, train tickets, and hire cars we needed to get from one to another. And we&#x2019;d kind of run out of options. So Lessona it was.</p>","<p>The houses thinned as we left Cossato behind. Before I could explain what &#x2018;marrish&#x2019; meant, she explained that we mightn&#x2019;t be the only ones arriving at her place that evening.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I have&#x2026;party at my house tonight. You see the real Italy. Dancing&#x2026;singing&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>","<p>Given her age and the tint of faded glamour about her, I feared that we may have stumbled into a small-town Piedmontese <em>La Grande Bellezza</em>, all superannuated, permabronzed ravers clinging desperately to a vision of <em>la Mondanit&#xE0;</em>, the fashionable high-life of Rome and Milan. We wanted Alexander and Eoin to see and taste the glories of Europe, but what would they make of Eurotrash? In the event, Jean-Paul Gaultier never showed up, and the music drifting around the pool area as we all sipped spumante that evening turned out to be nothing stronger than the coiffeured, neoclassical disco-waffle of Richard Clayderman.</p>","<p>We hung out with one of Laura&#x2019;s <em>consigliere</em>, Eduardo, a large, tanned Parmesan with a trimmed grey &#x2019;tache who exuded smoothness - as in physical frictionlessness. I wanted to lube him up and slide him across the lawn to knock over gnomes, but they don&#x2019;t do garden gnomes in Italy. We tried talking to him but couldn&#x2019;t, since he had no English. I found myself digging deep to get up some old Latin words I&#x2019;d learned in school, then applying the conjugation and declension rules I knew from Spanish, and seeing what worked.</p>","<p><em>&#x201C;Che?&#x201D;</em></p>","<p>Little did. Turned out Italian had moved on a bit since the Imperium Romanum. It also turned out that despite growing up in the same family as Spanish, most Italian words were in fact not interchangeable with those of its sibling. I simply wasn&#x2019;t learning it fast enough reading <em>Il Pendolo</em> and doing Duolingo on my phone. As a consequence, I&#x2019;d foolishly say things to Eduardo that were not really Italian at all, that stuck to nothing, and that just floated off towards the pool, whereupon Eduardo would respond with some sounds that didn&#x2019;t come together as actual English words either and which would just drop in the peanut dish, while Betty, Laura&#x2019;s friend, would look on, struggling, no doubt, to understand why we were all speaking Catalan. We sent the kids down to our basement quarters and said we&#x2019;d be down as soon as we&#x2019;d finished swatting the mozzies.</p>","<p>&#x201C;The <em>zanzare</em> are wrecking my buzz,&#x201D; I said to Tina.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, we&#x2019;re not a million miles from the rice paddies of Vercelli.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;You knew about this?&#x201D;</p>","<p>The next day Laura showed us around the B&amp;B. There were about five or six rooms for the guests, all different, and it was tastefully done up throughout. We imagined we&#x2019;d be getting acquainted with those rooms, turning them over as guests came and went. Interestingly, there were photographs of her throughout - on beaches, on mountains, in plazas, on more beaches - and rarely, if ever, was she smiling. No, she seemed quite serious in the photos. These photos were to be taken seriously. There was even one on our bedroom door, which, being secured by nothing more than a single nail, would bang cheaply against the door every time we went in or came out. That can turn you against a picture, I&#x2019;ve found, and even, over time, against the owner. They were legion, these windswept, artistic photos of Laura, and like bad luck often came in threes. After the tour of the house we presented ourselves for breakfast, expecting her to join us. She kind of did, by which I mean she sat with us, but ate not a <em>biscotto</em> nor any <em>pane</em>. In fact, she never broke bread with us during our stay. Rather, she scooted off after a minute to attend to the business of running her B&amp;B, but not before assigning me my job that first morning: I had a hedge to trim.</p>","<p><em>Santa Maria of the flaggelati</em>, it was hard work trimming that hedge. It turns out mosquitoes get annoyed by hedge trimmers. Those things just irritate them. You live and learn. You&#x2019;d think they&#x2019;d just move to the next hedge for the duration, then return when the racket had died down. When I was a child and my Mum started hoovering around me, I just went to another room. Maybe some of the mosquitoes did move to another hedge, but enough of the diehards scrambled to the air to take on the Bosch, or at least its operator, that my next hour became a misery. I had to stop every ten minutes to wipe my face clean and spit out the madmen in my mouth. At one stage Laura came to see how I was doing, announcing herself loudly from a distance as someone who has had a hedge trimmer around the house knows to do to someone using one, and kindly placed a few sprigs of basil behind my ears. They smelled nice and all that, but they just slid off with the sweat a minute or two later, and really, were very little match for the winged fury filling the air. Spraying myself with more Autan <em>repellente</em> than was probably good for me, I ploughed on. Doing her hedge that morning gave me a new-found appreciation for something I&#x2019;d taken for granted up to then. When you go to Italy, go to a museum or a galleria and have a good look at a Boticelli. Admire the artistry and the hard work that must have gone into it. Then go out into <em>la campagna</em> and look at a nicely-trimmed hedge. Admire the artistry of the straight lines, the pleasingly rounded corners and the constancy of height. But above all, acknowledge the masochism.</p>","<p>Tina had had to do some cleaning while I was at the hedge, and all the time the boys exploited the parental vacuum to play as much as they could on their Kindles. We spent the morning occupying ourselves as best we could with meaningful work that we thought would help our host, and when we had done so for roughly four hours we left it at that. She hadn&#x2019;t given us enough to do, or else she hadn&#x2019;t given us specific enough instruction on how to do what she <em>had</em> told us to do. Little did we realise it that first day, but this organisational lacuna would become a big problem in the coming days. You want to do your work in good faith and with a clear conscience, put the hedge trimmer away, pat it and say &#x2018;Good job old man.&#x2019;, brush your teeth and hose out your eyelids, then shower, regroup, and decide what you&#x2019;d all like to do with the rest of your day. One is in Italy to see and do Italian things. That first morning we left the B&amp;B compound, walked up the Via IV Novembre and the Via Roma and found a <em>caffetteria</em> not too far away called Dolce Vita with more wifi and less mosquitoes.</p>","<p>The days passed slowly, days in which we struggled to find meaningful tasks that would occupy us for our quota of hours. We quickly realised that Laura&#x2019;s understanding of the particular work exchange arrangement we had all signed up to was different to ours. Our value to her was as helpers &#x2018;on call&#x2019;, waiting around for the call downstairs for assistance even after we&#x2019;d knocked off for the day. One wanted to help, but jobs meant sweat, dirt, and <em>zanzare</em>, and as a helper you have a right to know when you&#x2019;re finished so you can clean up and go about your business. But we did get out into the surrounding area on a few occasions.</p>","<p>Laura lent us her car so we could visit Candelo, a small town where we had sundaes and watched some old-timers play <em>bocce</em>, the local version of boules/petanque. On another occasion she had an appointment with her solicitor and drove us into a larger town, Biella, where we caught the <em>funicolare</em> up to Piazzo hill, a natural refuge where eight hundred and fifty years ago people were encouraged to move in order to avoid the warring tribes below. Sitting there on the piazza you felt you could just reach out and touch the towering Alpi. And one evening she even took us up to the Chiesa San Bernardino overlooking Lessona itself and told us over grappi about the separation with her husband, who was seeing prostitutes, I think, or just moved to Iceland for business - it was hard to tell, to be honest, given her English and our Italian. Still, they were friends, and he still lived next door to her. Or he was insane, and visited prostitutes. I wasn&#x2019;t sure. We were sure it would all work out.</p>","<p>Most mornings before eight in the morning we would leave the kids playing their games in the basement while we walked up to the Dolce Vita, often stopping in the <em>pasticceria</em> first, for some <em>biscotti</em> or croissants. That early it was surprisingly cold out. Eduardo was still hanging around, days after the party. Was he Laura&#x2019;s lover? By all appearances hers was just a normal B&amp;B, in little need of an in-house DJ. Yet he seemed to spend most of his time in the breakfast area between the house and the pool making sure that the tempo of the chillbient music he was always playing never strayed above 60 bpm. Every conversation I tried with him ended with the same imperative to me: &#x201C;<em>Tranquillo, tranquillo.</em>&#x201D; Or, as he informed me they say in Napoli, &#x201C;<em>Chiani, chiani.</em>&#x201D; At night before turning in I used to inspect my expression in the mirror. Despite not being bothered by much really, except the <em>zanzare</em>, which had evolved, incredibly, in the short amount of time we&#x2019;d been here, to be able to sting me though my socks, socks I&#x2019;d rather not have been wearing, given the heat, and which may only, perversely, have served to attract them to the flashy delights therein contained, yes, despite not being bothered by much, I must have been facially projecting great angst to be so frequently exhorted to take it <em>tranquillo</em> by Eduardo.</p>","<p>&#x201C;&#x2019;E is jealous,&#x201D; Laura told us one night. &#x2019;E was jealous of a handsome, steely-grey-haired unsmiling businessman who had arrived that day and who apparently had designs on Laura. So she, naturally, fled downstairs, leaving us all wondering what to do with our new scary guest. I tried chatting with him. I told him I had recently read Roberto Saviano&#x2019;s <em>Gomorrah</em>.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Many people are not too happy with this book,&#x201D; he told me.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I suppose not,&#x201D; I laughed and smiled, inviting his laughter and smiles, the way you do. He didn&#x2019;t see what was so funny about that. We kept him topped up with <em>prosciutto</em> and <em>asti</em> until we could make a credible retreat to bed, leaving him and Eduardo to each others&#x2019; company, and may the best man win.</p>","<p>Not all Laura&#x2019;s guests were as sinister. I fell in love one night with a young French businesswoman in a black dress. She was in textiles. We hit it off in French, but that left Laura behind, so, remembering her ability with Spanish I thought it only gentlemanly to try to switch to accommodate her. Of course the mademoiselle could speak Spanish. Italian too. And English. With burning ankles despite the thickest socks I could root out of my suitcase, I thought to myself <em>Do your worst, you wing&#x2019;d nightmares - I&#x2019;m not moving until she does</em>. </p>","<p>Another night two gay guys (just a guess) with a poodle aroused my jealousy when they told me they&#x2019;d just been to the castle, <em>la Sacra di San Michele, </em>that inspired Umberto Eco as he wrote <em>The Name of the Rose</em>. I&#x2019;d have loved to have gone but it was on the far side of Turin. Too far. We didn&#x2019;t even have a car here. But we were thinking of getting one. Because we were thinking of leaving. Every night I would have to talk Tina off the ledge. She had begun to scout out flights online, fantasising about not being there.</p>","<p>&#x201C;What were we thinking?&#x201D; she&#x2019;d wail.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Come, come, dear, we&#x2019;re in Piedmont, and we haven&#x2019;t spent a penny on accommodation,&#x201D; I&#x2019;d console her. &#x201C;Sunny&#x2019;s going to take us to Milan.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Sunny was an expat yank of Cantonese extraction in Laura&#x2019;s circle of friends, whose husband was a big-game hunter. A significant part of a four-horned antelope stuck out of the wall of her entertainment pavilion which we got invited to one day for lunch. She was someone with whom we could at least talk in English to. Actually, since we found it hard to get a word in, we could at least hear English being spoken. At one stage during the lunch I listened to her and Betty talking about us, what the arrangement was, etc., since they were all quite curious, and to my alarm I heard Laura correct them: &#x201C;No, it&#x2019;s just bed and breakfast.&#x201D; Which wasn&#x2019;t true, but which explained a lot. She didn&#x2019;t understand how the work exchange worked, and if I could have explained it to her I would have but the fact was we just didn&#x2019;t click with her anymore. From that day we started a go-slow, daring her to &#x2018;sack&#x2019; us, while we looked for alternative places over cappuccinos in the Dolce Vita.</p>","<p>Still, she was a nice woman. And an honest one. We knew that because she told us. She also told us that she always spoke her mind. She certainly spoke her mind with the computer when she couldn&#x2019;t get the thing to print off some invoices on our last morning. Oh, she got in a terrible flap about that printer.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Why this does not work? Why? Whyyy?&#x201D;</p>","<p>We had a look. The reason it didn&#x2019;t work was that each time she went to print an invoice the printer dialog window would pop-up, but she was clicking print on the same one over and over, not realising that new documents spawned new windows, unless, of course, one closed the previous ones. It made me realise that there was probably nothing wrong with her swimming pool either, which she had got in a terrible flap about too the day before. I left Tina in charge of showing her how the computer worked while I went outside to the garden where Alexander and Eoin were kicking a football. When I came back in Tina caught my eye.</p>","<p>&#x201C;She&#x2019;s not happy with us,&#x201D; she said, <em>sotto voce</em>.</p>","<p>&#x201C;I am not &#x2018;appy!&#x201D; Laura said, not particularly <em>sotto voce</em>. &#x201C;This is a big problem for me. Never before I &#x2018;ave this.&#x201D;</p>","<p>The complete lack of chemistry had finally come to the boil, and she was ending the experiment. We felt hard done by, all the same. What about her last set of helpers she&#x2019;d told us about - the Chileans who just sat around the pool all afternoon, drinking and being rowdy? I suppose it was no skin off their nose to have been on call, but that wasn&#x2019;t what we wanted, and it wasn&#x2019;t the usual Help Exchange way. She said they showed initiative, those South Americans. One of them had even suggested they could rearrange the stuff in her room, whereas we, on the other hand, had always needed to be told what to do, like helpless bambini. Was she serious? Rearrange her bedroom? She was, unfortunately. For our part, we had always presumed she&#x2019;d have jobs she needed doing which she might describe to us. In our own home, we had taken in three work exchange couples before our trip, to help us get the house ready for renting but also to get some experience working with strangers and to learn what works and what doesn&#x2019;t. In our limited experience, telling people the work you expect them to do, and roughly how long it should take, works. Acknowledging the end of their shift and thanking them for it works. Not doing any of that doesn&#x2019;t.</p>","<p>Yes, we learned our lesson in Lessona. Laura drove us to Cossato train station the next day. With a newfound fluency she lamented it hadn&#x2019;t worked out between us but it was better to admit this straightaway, or at least, after only a week. We agreed. Passing through Lessono, I regretted not having gone in at any stage. I suppose we always imagined we&#x2019;d do it tomorrow, or the day after. At the train station, she helped us get our stuff out of the boot of her Fiat. We embraced her and said goodbye, gathering up Alexander and Eoin and our bags outside the station caf&#xE9;.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ok boys, everyone wave goodbye to Laura.&#x201D;</p>","<p>She got in her car and drove away without a backward glance.</p>"],["<p>Alessandro loved his penis. You could just tell. He obviously loved tattoos too. Was his dick tattooed? He didn&#x2019;t tell me. He hadn&#x2019;t actually told me about his cock-love either, but I could tell he adored his member because whenever I went over to his fridge to fetch a drop of milk for one of my frequent cups of tea I&#x2019;d see the large fridge magnet there - &#x201C;I Love My Penis&#x201D; - attesting to his <em>amore</em>. In our house at home in Brisbane, we use the front of the fridge as a place to put grocery lists and jog happy memories with tacky magnets from Dublin, Catalonia, or Japan. Before Milan, I suppose I&#x2019;d never really imagined a fridge magnet as the right platform for the other sort of message. Not very Italian of me, I know. But, you see, Alessandro was in fashion. If you&#x2019;re in fashion in Milan the front of your fridge is like a vertical catwalk; a surface on which to flaunt it.</p>","<p>Once we realised we were never going to last the full term in Laura&#x2019;s we&#x2019;d looked at cutting our losses in Italy and rescheduling the flights we&#x2019;d booked to Zakynthos to leave immediately instead of in two-and-a-half weeks time, but it turned out that that would have cost us virtually the full price of the flights. May as well stick around, we reasoned, even though we&#x2019;d have to pay board for every night from that point on until we reached Zakynthos. In Lessona&#x2019;s Dolce Vita <em>caffetteria</em>, with its <em>biscotti</em> and wifi, Alessandro&#x2019;s flat had looked interesting enough to entice us for an initial three days. We&#x2019;d always intended getting across to Milan from Laura&#x2019;s, just for daytrips, but now it looked like the most suitable base from which to plan our next few weeks. Back in TruePay managers were always popping over to Milan, a state of affairs which filled people like me, na&#xEF;fs who didn&#x2019;t grasp what that actually entailed, hearing only the melody of the name of a place we&#x2019;d never been to, with envy and resentment. Turned out the most they&#x2019;d probably see would be the sign for Monza on the way into the retail park office from the airport. We, on the other hand, had the obscene amount of time a fintech project manager could only fantasise about.</p>","<p>Our intention was to make a more rigorous assessment of Alessandro&#x2019;s in situ before extending by a few days if we liked it. Within the first hour we could usually tell whether a place was a keeper, in which case we&#x2019;d request to amend our stay for the amount of time we really wanted it for. Since the owners invariably ask for the second tranch to be paid with the folding stuff, on the quiet, and under the <em>tavolo - </em>well, they&#x2019;re the boss - this way is not without its advantages. Now, you obviously run the risk of being gazumped, if you will, by anyone who&#x2019;s booked the extra time you want a place for in the interim, but if you&#x2019;re quick enough she&#x2019;ll be right. And so, like Caesar, we came, we saw, and we quite liked the look of the place, fridge magnets notwithstanding, so we asked Alessandro about the rest of the week. &#x201C;As long as I can come back for some of my things. I want to to go to the beach.&#x201D;</p>","<hr>","<p>Before it became part of the Kingdom of Italy, Milan rose up against its Austro-Hungarian overlords in 1848 in what became known as the Five Days of Milan revolt. We had risen up against our own circumstances in Lessona to have our own Five Days in Milan (six, actually, if you count the sixth day). Unlike the Milanesi, who went about joining the Savoy dominions, we didn&#x2019;t quite know what to do with ourselves with all that freedom so we just made ourselves at home in Alessandro&#x2019;s apartment.</p>","<p>Some places we&#x2019;d been in had a nice garden. Some had nice views. This place had neither, but what it lacked in the usual amenities it made up for with interesting things, most of them white. Now, there&#x2019;s nothing terribly strange in finding yourself in a place with white walls, a white roof, and white shelving. But an army of ceramic and plastic figures and knick-knacks on the shelves, all gloriously, virginally, white? There were smurfs, Davids, Venus de Milos, and Terminators. There was a white hand with its middle-finger gratuitously raised in defiance. There were abstract prints in white and off-white, in white frames. And in case we thought that this was all happenstance, or that these had all been bleached over the years by the Lombardy sun streaming in through the large windows giving out on to the courtyard, there was a signature item on one of the shelves, the key to the whole schema, which embodied Alessandro&#x2019;s monochromatic manifesto: an all-white Rubik&#x2019;s Cube.</p>","<p>We settled in and hung our washing out in the echoing hollow core of the building around which the apartment curved, three floors up, by tying it to a hallway window on one side and the toilet window on the other. We availed of the copious reading material and sought inspiration in the uncommonly chic appurtenances scattered throughout. An entire wall of books, many of them fashion-related, was ours for the perusing, including &#x2018;Big Books&#x2019; of Boobs, Butts, Pussy, and Dick. I mean, that&#x2019;s what they were called: <em>The Big Book of Butts</em>. I swear. With companion volumes on boobs, pussy, and dicks, as I say. Who buys this stuff? And then just leaves it around where innocent tourists can easily, if they balance on the arm of the white sofa, carefully moving the pile of vintage Vogue magazines to the side, reach up and get it?</p>","<p>In the middle of the kitchen area, there was a glass-covered <em>bigliardino</em> table - what the French call <em>babyfoot</em>, the Americans call <em>fussball</em>, and we call table football - which we used, cover in place of course, as a dinner table, on Alessandro&#x2019;s instructions. On waking up, the first thing we&#x2019;d see evey morning was a huge, old-fashioned TV, well-polished and lovingly-kept, empty of any actual apparatus. Vintage radios, cameras, and even a jukebox crowded each other on every available bit of shelf and surface space. Being in Alessandro&#x2019;s, indeed, being in Milan, we&#x2019;d soon find, was like being in an exhibition of twentieth-century design.</p>","<p>Down by the Navigli (canals) and around the Cimitero Monumentale we strolled on sunny afternoons, holding off on visiting some of the more famous sites such as the Scala and the San Siro stadium that were way out of our <em>Liga</em>. In the Pinacoteca di Brera, which, I&#x2019;m warning you, has a statue of a naked Napoleon in the courtyard, and museums like the one in Castello Sforzesco, we pointed Alexander and Eoin at famous icons of the Renaissance: paintings like Mantegna&#x2019;s <em>Cristo Morto</em>, with its foreshortened Jesus, and sundry Modiglianis, Raffaells, Bronzinos and Caravaggios. When they began to flag under the weight of all that <em>chiaroscuro</em> and <em>sfumato</em> we got them to keep a running tally of ugly baby Jesuses, since either the idea of beauty had drifted a lot over the centuries or some heretical statement was being made in many of the paintings: either way, they tallied up some real shockers in there.</p>","<p>They also got more experience in Milan in navigating underground train systems: a vital travel skill for young chaps. By the time we&#x2019;d finished this trip, I intended the two of them to be consummate international metro travellers. In Vienna, our U-Bahn mantra had been: &#x201C;Take your hands out of your pockets when you walk downstairs. Do you want to kill yourselves? I don&#x2019;t care how cold it is.&#x201D; In London they learned to Mind&#x2026;the Gap. Here, we discovered that the automatic sliding gates that open up when you put your card in them don&#x2019;t work when you stand too close. If you have to get yourself and a kid, travelling for free, through on the same ticket, and that kid is terrified of the gate closing on them and amputating their arms, the kid will bunch up with you and press against the gate. The gate will not open; at least the gates at Marche subway station won&#x2019;t. Now we know that, but it took us the full six days and much angst and climbing over the gates and staring at the gates wondering what was happening, and cursing the gates, before, on our last day, we worked it out.</p>","<p>Another good rule of thumb in a metro is to ignore the hawkers. On the M5 line one day our attention was drawn to a truly cacophonous sound. A rotund, middle-aged guy was working his way through the carriage wheezing atonally into a harmonica, or just playing something by Schopenhauer on it. We don&#x2019;t use the train much in Australia, and in any case, there are very few hawkers on them, so naturally enough the four of us turned and stared at him. We were the only people in the carriage paying him the slightest attention. That was our first mistake. As he approached I made my second mistake: I caught his eye. He addressed me in excellent English, commenting on the t-shirt I&#x2019;d bought in Budapest. But he was clear-eyed and seemed educated, not drunk or drug-addled in any way. He had no job and needed money for his mentally-handicapped kid. I gave him a euro.</p>","<p>Despite the fact that many of the shops in the city had signs saying &#x2018;<em>Chiuso Per Ferie</em>&#x2019; we managed to buy an Italian blue Bialletti Moka Express (also known as a Stovetop Espresso). Bialletti is the brand whose mascot is the funny man with the moustache raising his arm into the air, with an imperiously pointing index finger, driving home the point that with the Moka one will enjoy &#x201C;<em>in casa un espresso come al bar</em>&#x201D; (&#x201C;an espresso at home just like one in the bar.&#x201D;) In the Ferrari shop, the kids thrilled to a half-sized Lego F1 racing car and we all lusted after the designer watches, apparel, and mini-Ferraris, but in the end just felt like barbarians at the gates of obscene wealth. Rich middle-eastern tourists paid for turns on the F1 simulators downstairs while their wives, in burqas, recorded their husbands on iPads. We felt bad not being able to afford any of this for the kids, but by this stage we all knew the score. They did get a more affordable Lego Ferrari sports car in the gift shop of the Leonardo da Vinci Science Museum. Lego souvenirs are the best souvenirs - momentos of places that you can actually play with. We toyed briefly with the idea of going out to Modena to see the actual Ferrari headquarters but once again realised that, pricewise, it may as well have been on the moon. We even baulked at paying into the Duomo di Milano, the massive Cathedral in the middle of the city. Milan, unlike Brisbane, actually still has a city centre wherein the cathedral is the biggest building in the vicinity. In our city the cathedrals, while obviously not up to the same standard as the likes of Milan&#x2019;s, aren&#x2019;t bad, but they&#x2019;re inevitably underwhelming for being shadowed by a fifty-storey insurance building or apartment block. In Milan, however, you can stand in awe at the Duomo, walk around it and sense its grandeur, all for free, without having to set foot inside it or ascend to its roof.</p>","<p>Likewise in Piazza Affari, where we stood outside the Stock Exchange, but there our attention was not on the colonnaded square or the classical lines of the Borsa Italiana itself but rather the arresting sculpture in the middle of the square. It was a large statue of a hand, veiny and solid, giving us the finger. The one whose likeness I&#x2019;d seen on the shelf in our apartment. And there was me thinking that little piece was just a joke, never for a second imagining there was a real object, in a pretty serious location, no less, that existed, it seemed, to tell everyone to fuck off. But I&#x2019;d been wrong. We&#x2019;d been dismissed in Lessona; now we were being told to shove it in Milan: Italy was tough going. But we had our white apartment to retreat to when it all got too much.</p>","<p>Alessandro came back one day to get his beach stuff and his goldfish. Catching its eye on its way out the door, I thought about all the Airbnb pets - all those discombobulated furry and scaled victims of the gig economy. Then they were gone, and the place was ours again. It was beginning to feel dangerously like home. Every day when we climbed those stairs and turned the key to the apartment, having fl&#xE2;nned ourselves to a standstill, I&#x2019;d pour myself a glass and read while someone in the upstairs apartment played Louis Stewart jazz guitar, vibing me nicely. Kids played outside in the pebbly courtyard near the block&#x2019;s Madonnina, one of the little shrines to the Virgin Mary found everywhere in Italy. It was nearly Ferragosto, the national celebration of the Assumption of the Mary.</p>"],["<p>The longer we spent in Italy, the more perverse it seemed that we&#x2019;d ever thought it a good idea to sequester ourselves away for the whole Italian leg in a B&amp;B trimming hedges and turning bedrooms over. We&#x2019;d kept it fairly low-key in Milan, not even venturing out of the city, but when a back of the envelope calculation revealed we&#x2019;d soon be at the equinox between the summer of our leaving Dublin and the autumn of our returning to Brisbane the urgency to see much more of Italy began to set in. How short-sighted we&#x2019;d been! With only about ten days till Greece our obligation to Italy, surely, was to live, live like people who had travelled a long way to see Europe and found themselves in Italy in the summertime.</p>","<p>We hired a car and crossed the Appennines into Tuscany, desperate for farmhouses, restaurants, bakeries - you name it - that that would take our money and help us atone for our parsimony and timidity. Over the next ten days we haemorrhaged money, buying train passes, paninis, gelatos, and pizzas. We frittered our euros away on autostrada tolls, getting to the Cinque Terre for a swim in the harbour in Vernazza; shuttling over Lake Como between Bellano, Bellagio, and Menaggio; and buying an authentic, made in Italy, Pinocchio in the village of Collodi, Province of Lucca, Tuscany, the place from which the author of the book took his name. Our little wooden boy had adjustable limbs and a white hat, not a red one, since those had been introduced by Disney according to the <em>donna</em> we bought him from. Shoulder to shoulder with fellow tourists we joined in the joyful communal worship of Michelangelo&#x2019;s David and the Leaning Tower of Pisa. We marveled at the statue of Laoco&#xF6;n grappling with the serpent in Florence; stood open-mouthed in the gilded interior of Basilica di Santa Maria della Steccata in Parma, and I thought to myself: this is even more ridiculous than Stift Melk&#x2019;s Baroque church, all that time ago at the beginning of our trip; and threw away money we simply didn&#x2019;t have on things like a fancy tablecloth we&#x2019;d treasure back at home and Bouffon (Eoin) and Ronaldo (Alexander) soccer tops for the boys.</p>","<hr>","<blockquote>\n<p>&#x201C;<em>When he saw them from above, he always thought the travelers looked like cogs in an intricate, swirling machine. But up close, amid the bustle and the stampede everything just seemed noisy and disconnected.</em>&#x201D; Brian Selznick, <em>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>","<p>In Florence we&#x2019;d just given up the pretence that were going to avoid the crowds. In Lucca, however, we found some space. Just outside the city walls we stayed on the top floor of a renovated farmhouse whose resident 95-year old nonna, the grandmother of our <em>padrona di casa</em>, watched us struggle with our bags up the steps she&#x2019;d just made short work of. &#x201C;<em>Tanta scala!</em>&#x201D; she chirped, her smiling face almost unlined, or so it seemed in the late afternoon Tuscan light. On the grounds was a red Vespa with a target in red, white and green - an Italian target - that seemed incongruously iconic and design-y for its rural surrounds.</p>","<p>We fished four bangers of bikes out of the shed, pumped the tires up, adjusted the saddles, and cycled the perimeter of Lucca on its thick defensive walls. That&#x2019;s right: the walls were so thick you could cycle on them. They were as wide as a road. By the time they finished building them, the threat that provoked their construction in the first place had passed. Within the bosom of its walls we were kings in Lucca. We were in the right place. Every moment within its confines was a moment well spent, and it was real in a way that Carcassonne hadn&#x2019;t seemed, even if you had to move to the side to avoid the rubbish lorry or the businessman going too fast on a bike. Lucca was like an angel whose wings had stopped moving. Never mind that most of the Wednesday market stuff was made in China, when you could get pistachio gelato in the Piazzo dell&#x2019;Anfiteatro, or take coffee in the lee of the wedding cake church while the boys threw their new (made in China) Euros 2016 mini-football to each other. There were palazzos everywhere with horizontal alternating terracotta and pale yellow stripes offset with doorway arches in the same scheme. And boxy campaniles whose ascending levels showed an increasing amount of windows, contradicting one&#x2019;s sense of perspective, going from one to two to three, albeit narrowing in girth, when it felt like it should have been the other way around. We often found ourselves wondering what we&#x2019;d have been doing back in Laura&#x2019;s if we&#x2019;d stayed. Whatever it was it would most likely have involved confusion and <em>zanzarre</em>. Most importantly, we stopped worrying about the money.</p>","<p>On Ferragosto itself, the 15th of August, we tried to have a picnic on a dramatic rocky crag that we could see in the distance somewhere in Emilia-Romagna from our top-floor farmhouse window, but on driving up the narrow mountain road we belatedly realised we&#x2019;d been seriously mistaken to think we could get anywhere near it on that of all days. Or that the boys were up to ascending it. In the event, we found a weedy path off the main walking trail near the foot of the outcrop and pretended to have a splendid picnic, standing there with our soggy cheese sandwiches listening to the laughter and clinking of glasses of the people in the restaurant beside us.</p>","<p>But our Italian improved bit by bit, to the extent that when we took our hosts in Emilia-Romagna up on their offer to cook for us - &#xE0; la Didier, back at Saint-Michel-de-Lan&#xE8;s at Easter - we were able to spend the entire evening kind of chatting with them. They spoke no English whatsoever: it was all up to us. They were an older couple - he was an electrician, she ran the household with its several quarters. We had to dig deep just to be able to get through the two or so hours, and it was a memorable evening. The best ten euros worth I&#x2019;ve ever had in my life. When they weren&#x2019;t eating, the boys rode around the courtyard on bicycles that our hosts kids&#x2019; had long outgrown, chased by the house dog.</p>","<p>In Florence&#x2019;s Palazzo Vecchio, our tour guide had used the old Latin phrase <em>festina lente</em> at one stage in his telling of the story of some mural, duke, or statue, the meaning of which, he reminded us, was &#x2018;make haste slowly&#x2019; or &#x2018;hurry up, but take your time&#x2019;. Back in Lombardy on the eve of our leaving Italy, sitting in a mouldy pair of deckchairs on the balcony of a distinctly mediocre apartment high above the town of Bellano, on the edge of Lake Como, it occurred to me that <em>festina lente</em> was the motto of our grand tour of Italy. We&#x2019;d seen as much as we could in the small time left to us, but we took it easy doing so. At least part of the wall of mountains to our north must have been Switzerland. But our minds now were on Greece - the end of the long road.</p>"]]},{"index":17,"title":"Reaching Ithaka","pages":[["<p>Flying out of Milan&#x2019;s Linate airport, I felt like we&#x2019;d gotten away with it. From so inauspicious a start in Italy we&#x2019;d turned things around. The pressure was off, and we could go to Greece knowing we&#x2019;d done as much as we could under our financially-straitened circumstances. Out the starboard window the Apennines ran the length of the leg of the Italian peninsula. We&#x2019;d see it all one day. </p>","<p>Descending gradually over the west coast of Zakynthos, we flew over <em>Nav&#xE1;gio</em>, Shipwreck Beach, fast becoming one of the most photographed places in Greece, if not Europe. It was a bit of a shame that our beloved island was becoming more crowded each season, but still, let them come - it didn&#x2019;t directly affect us too much considering the backwater Koukla House was situated in. Two minutes further southeast we looked out the port-side window and saw the village of Keri, where we often go to watch the sunset. I remembered the evening last year the Maestro, unbeknownst to us, had been up there too, his presence only becoming apparent at the critical moment, just when the sun&#x2019;s tired pink disc, all flattened and shimmering, hit the surface of the Ionian Sea, at which point he stepped out in front of us, singing his own &#x2018;<em>Zakynthoula Mou Mikri</em>&#x2019;, and turned to us as if to say &#x201C;Where would you rather be?&#x201D;</p>","<p>Having flown past the Marathia peninsula, the south-western tip of the island, for all the world a planeful of people on their way to Pylos or Crete, we doubled back and made our final descent over Laganas Bay, natural home to loggerhead turtles and hedonists. The polar opposite of how we&#x2019;d gotten to the island last spring, but then this was the end of the road, and a different season. There&#x2019;d be no school. No <em>mandolinada</em> group either, it&#x2019;d turn out. Nor road trips around the Peloponnese. And hopefully no Grexit hysteria, no pointless referendums, and no cashless ATMs.</p>","<hr>","<p>We were now in a season in which, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, it appeared first over the jagged edge of the Vasilikos peninsula, just like it did every morning from our balcony last spring, only this time about five miles further south and twenty minutes later. When that first light broke the hilltop every morning, it was as if the pressure of the growing brightness behind the mountain snagged the taut fabric of the sky on the jagged top of <em>Skop&#xF3;s</em>, making the sunlight spill through and flood everything.</p>","<p>Yiayia and Pappou weren&#x2019;t there this time, but as soon as we arrived their (and, I suppose, our) friend Yiorgos, who looks after Koukla House when none of us are there, came by with plastic bags of grapes for us. It was the time of the year for <em>tr&#xED;go</em>: the grape harvest. Despite our best efforts each evening, however, we could never eat all the grapes he left us. They&#x2019;d accumulate in our fridge, and split and go off. We didn&#x2019;t like throwing food out on the compost heap that someone we knew had cultivated and gathered up to bring to us but if the bugs and the birds could benefit from the <em>tr&#xED;go</em>, then good, because we couldn&#x2019;t keep up.

The Greeks reckon that&#x2019;s the recipe for a long and healthy life. We lived on <em>bougatsas</em> (a type of pastry, hence a source of wheat) up at caf&#xE9; Freddo at the village crossroads at Lithaki&#xE1;; Yiorgos had sorted us out for olive oil. Two out of three. When we found out about a family near us who made decent red wine for less than three euros a litre, the triad was complete. Wine tastes better, I&#x2019;ve found, when you buy it off people who sit you down, show an interest in you, compliment your faltering Greek, and stick a big bunch of grapes in the bag alongside the bottles you&#x2019;re buying, even though, at that rate, we&#x2019;d soon need a second fridge.</p>","<p>Fires raged in the dry dog days of late August in inland villages up in the mountains. I&#x2019;d sit on the balcony with a frapp&#xE9;, half reading my Eco, half watching the red and yellow twin-prop fire-fighting planes as they came off the mountain, droning low overhead in pairs, their shadows following the contours of the garden behind our house, shading the vines and fig trees. I&#x2019;d walk through the house to the sea-facing balcony on the other side and watch as they descended over the hotel to splash down and shave a layer of Laganas bay off into their tanks, banking up and over the beach back on their trek inland, over and over, the one always about ten seconds behind the other, fading into the haze towards the tall column of smoke on the mountain of Vrachionas. At night we&#x2019;d watch the pilots being interviewed on local TV, and I&#x2019;d think - that takes guts; those guys are heroes.</p>","<p>Hunting season started with a bang at the beginning of September. Tradition dictates that men don camouflage pants and sit in hidden lookouts in olive groves early in autumn mornings, waiting for the opportunity to shoot turtle doves, <em>trig&#xF3;nia</em>, which have stopped off temporarily on one of their great migration paths south to Africa. We&#x2019;d occasionally come across the hunters&#x2019; stations, littered with fag ends and shotgun cartridges, in the groves around us as we made our way around the roads and lanes of Porta Koukla.</p>"],["<p>It had always been our idea on this trip to establish a network of safe houses and friendly outposts in Europe that we could use again some fine day, and not just to treat couchsurfing hosts as one-off, free alternatives to paying for our board. To that end we had offered everyone who&#x2019;d hosted us over the past eighteen months the use of Koukla House when we were there again, and now here we were. Incredibly, given the offer, only one family took us up on the offer - our very first couchsurfing hosts: Nina and Felix. They and their two kids flew in from Salzburg and stayed with us for two weeks, taking the downstairs apartment in Koukla House. Having people we&#x2019;d met on the very earliest part of our trip join us here on the very last part of it lent the trip a pleasingly holistic quality.</p>","<p>Nina&#x2019;s blog had come on since the last time we&#x2019;d met.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Last month I was invited to stay in a hotel for free.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;For free? What&#x2019;s the catch?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, of course, I had to write about it on my blog.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;That could have been awkward. I hope it was good.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh yes, very good.&#x201D;</p>","<p>We&#x2019;d been posting to our travel blog (kouklahouse.com) for the last year and a half, with articles about Vienna, Greece, Ireland, France, etc., to almost universal indifference (I owe the word &#x2018;almost&#x2019; to Mum). We knew the true freedom of the utterly ignored. We could truly say what we wanted. When they could be bothered to read it, our friends would know where we were and what we were up to, and we never expected any more to come of it than that. Once in a while somebody from some company&#x2019;s marketing department would write to us asking us if we&#x2019;d be interested in writing a piece for their web site for free in return for some nebulous quid pro quo like &#x2018;exposure to a much larger audience&#x2019; or &#x2018;inclusion in our best-of-the-web round-up&#x2019;. Certain phrases and keywords, such as &#x2018;one of the most interesting boutique hotels in the luxury space&#x2019;, would have to appear somewhere in the text. No thanks. Our blog was our authentic voice. I only hoped Nina would manage to maintain her blog&#x2019;s integrity in the corroding environment of freebie culture, but I didn&#x2019;t think that was possible.</p>","<p>Over the years we&#x2019;ve always kept a few quieter spots on the island up our sleeve, places to retreat to in the summertime madness or to show off to visitors. Limni&#xF3;nas has probably always been our favourite, a rocky inlet down a winding and eroded path dropping away from &#xC1;gios L&#xE9;on, a village on the west coast with not much in it save an olive press and a workshop selling olivewood candle-holders and cutting boards. And, of course, a taverna or two. But the village&#x2019;s serenity was deceptive, as we found out when we drove there one morning with the Austrians. On finally cresting the point overlooking the inlet we found the parking area full, to our surprise, and the previously cosy and inconspicuous taverna spread halfway down to the water&#x2019;s edge. There were a lot of Italians and a lot of Bulgarians (according to Nina, who identified the language we were hearing) laid out on blankets, blocking the paths. Sadly, Limni&#xF3;nas had been discovered. It used to be quiet; a spot where locals, and semi-locals like us, could come and jump into the deep water off the sagging and broken concrete mini-piers used by fishers. But that was then. Back then, Trip Advisor wasn&#x2019;t the homogenising steamroller it is now. According to the woman who served us after our swim in the taverna back up in &#xC1;gios L&#xE9;on itself, mercifully still quiet, it&#x2019;s become the number two spot on the island, after Shipwreck Beach.</p>","<p>The island experienced some fierce late summer storms, which I&#x2019;m sure jarred with the Salzburgers&#x2019; expectations of what summer in Zante looked like. One morning we watched a force of nature we&#x2019;d never before seen, a waterspout, menace Laganas Bay, losing sight of it as it made landfall right over the main strip. After the Salzburgers left Mum arrived with cash to spend and a gusto for the tavernas but brought with her even more bad weather. I had to drive out twice to the airport the night she arrived. Her plane had been sitting on the tarmac in Dublin airport for two hours when it should at that stage have been over the Alps. Apparently the pilot had informed everyone that there were turtles on the runway at Zakynthos airport: obviously the standard line among crews for when the weather here in Zante prevents planes taking off. Loggerhead turtles (C<em>aretta caretta</em>) are pretty much sacrosanct on Zakynthos.</p>","<p>Unlike last year, when the main square in town, Solomou Square, was a shuttered-off building site, it was looking mighty fine those long evenings in September. The museum had reopened, our old favourite <em>Kokkinos Vrachos</em> (&#x2018;Red Cliffs&#x2019;) was once again the caf&#xE9; to be seen at, and the guy outside Alektor taverna was in irrepressible form. Out on the town one Friday night we let him sweep us off the main drag of Plate&#xED;a Democrat&#xED;as into the restaurant and sit us at a table beside a young Japanese couple instagramming a squid. Two guys played sweet island music on guitar and mandolin.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Bravo! Damn, I love Zakynthos!&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not Zakynthian music,&#x201D; Tina sniffed. She recognised some songs from the soundtracks to some old &#x2018;60s Aliki (the Brigit Bardot of Greece, kind of) movies. Those lively potboilers are a staple of the Bozikis home in Brisbane. I swear, some people aren&#x2019;t happy until they&#x2019;ve snuffed out your every little moment of pleasure.</p>","<hr>","<p>For all that we&#x2019;d reconnected with a family from much earlier in our trip, we found it much harder to do so, ironically, with the friends we&#x2019;d made there on Zakynthos the first year. The Maestro was too busy for music this time around. Same with the people we&#x2019;d gone on walks with. Although we did occasionally bump into old friends in town and caught up on the gossip. One particularly juicy morsel concerned a recent &#x2018;love triangle&#x2019; murder, wherein an Egyptian had killed a Pakistani in a knife fight &#x2018;over a woman&#x2019;: this explanation was roundly poo-poohed by all, apparently, as flimflam thrown up by the defense of the murderer to soften the hearts of the cops. According to our well-connected friend, &#x2018;twas a thieves&#x2019; falling out, nothing more.</p>","<p>The previous year, our social life had been like calling around to a friend on a Saturday morning. &#x201C;Hey, come on in - want a coffee?&#x201D; This time of the year, on the other hand, was like arriving at their house at 7:30 on a Monday morning and expecting that same coffee. The friends you wanted to be with didn&#x2019;t have the time: the people you didn&#x2019;t want bothering you had all day to do it. Walking along the beachfront at Agios Sostis one morning, a finger landed on my chest. &#x201C;You do not look like a Magyar.&#x201D;</p>","<p>It was one of the boat rental guys. I was wearing my Budapest t-shirt. &#x201C;The sun is out, my friend, it&#x2019;s sunshining, it&#x2019;s a beautiful day&#x2026;if you rent a boat&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>","<p>We didn&#x2019;t want a boat, but I felt like asking him if he wanted a coffee. After the storms of autumn had battered the place he was still there (and I was probably wearing that same tee.) &#x201C;A good day for you to surf, my friend.&#x201D; I imagined on Christmas day he would still be there, indefatigable, optimistic, selling pine trees, the shades and shorts having given way to a scarf and Santa beard.</p>","<hr>","<p>So we had to amuse ourselves. Which meant exploring the island, something you don&#x2019;t really need others for. Of all the facets of Greek and Zakynthian history - the classical, ancient world; the era of Venetian rule; the hated Ottoman yolk, and the War of Independence - there was one more recent history with precious few visible artifacts still extant. There can&#x2019;t be too many corners of Europe untouched by the Second World War. Even Australia got bombed. And certainly Zakynthos suffered, as Yiayia and Pappou could personally attest to. There&#x2019;s not much left to see from that period. Why would there be? But we went out one fine day to see a something we&#x2019;d never seen before in all our time on Zante. On a hill by the coast down near the end of one of the two protruding arms of the island, the German Army had built gun emplacements to guard the entrance of Laganas Bay. In the event they were never used, but according to the guidebook we&#x2019;d bought last year there were still concrete bunkers up there somewhere.</p>","<p>A decapitated hare and some old Venetian wells were our waypoints through the Aleppo pines on the way up to the hill paths behind G&#xE9;rakas beach. Over dunes and mounds we walked before stumbling upon some odd concrete extrusions that surely meant the bunkers were in the immediate vicinity. The sunlight was so bright, however, and the view out over Laganas Bay so distracting, that I barely noticed Alexander&#x2019;s floppy camouflage hat descending a set of concrete stairs into the ground just then. I followed him into a fully-fledged hexagonal concrete cell, with plenty of graffiti on its interior walls, closed off except for a foot-high panoramic slit giving a strangely serene view down to the beach and headland a couple of kilometres away. The implicit violence of the structure was utterly, obscenely, at odds with the tranquility and beauty of the setting. In fact, it&#x2019;s so quiet there on the shoulder hills of Kan&#xF3;nia, as the area is called on account of those cannon emplacements, that boats aren&#x2019;t even allowed off G&#xE9;rakas on account of the loggerheads.</p>","<hr>","<p>Mum went home, the tourists began to drift away, and time, our biggest enemy, was stalking us relentlessly. The end of the road was nigh. Sitting outside in the evenings, watching the boats come back in from Marathonisi island we felt the autumn closing in, and with it the commute, the office, the excruciating morning stand-up.</p>","<p>A few days before we left I was on my way up to the mini-market behind our house for some Mythos and nougat, or something or other. We were allowed to use a path that went through a couple of fields belonging to an old guy we&#x2019;d often see out there watering his beans or planting his tomatoes. On my way up to the shops I came across him sitting on a plastic chair under a tree taking sips from a glass of water. Considering I was on his land, the least I could do was greet him.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Kalimera.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Kalimera sas.&#x201D;</p>","<p>We got chatting. Now, when I say we got chatting, what I mean is he kept saying something about what sounded like &#x201C;nyonyo&#x201D;, and I kept apologising for not knowing that word.</p>","<p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s &#x2018;nyonyo&#x2019;?&#x201D; I&#x2019;d say, and he&#x2019;d flesh out the concept of &#x2018;nyonyo&#x2019; a little more. &#x201C;Agapimeni nyonyo&#x201D;. No, I couldn&#x2019;t get it. My Greek just wasn&#x2019;t up to it. It was probably the plant he was after sowing. In my experience, if you&#x2019;re talking to an old Greek guy, they&#x2019;re probably talking about something they&#x2019;re growing. At any rate, he pressed on me once again the urgent matter of &#x201C;nyonyo&#x201D;. I promised I&#x2019;d look into it. On the way back he was still there.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Nyonyo!&#x201D;</p>","<p>When I got home I dumped the groceries on the counter.</p>","<p>&#x201C;What in the name of Zeus&#x2019;s thunderbolt is a &#x2018;nyonyo&#x2019;?&#x201D; I asked Tina. &#x201C;Your man in the field kept talking about a &#x2018;nyonyo&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Nyonyo&#x2019;?&#x201D; It took her a few seconds. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s my Dad&#x2019;s nickname. It&#x2019;s a diminutive for Dionysios. He means Dad. They&#x2019;ve been friends since they were kids.&#x201D;</p>","<p>In that case, I&#x2019;d be happy to pass on a greeting from one old Greek guy, who stayed on the island and still worked his fields, to another, who emigrated to Australia after the great earthquake of &#x2019;53 and made his life there, coming back now and again with his family, and even, some fifteen years ago, building a house there, the one we were leaving in the morning: Koukla House.</p>"],["<p>Yiorgos drove us to the ferry terminal the day we left Zakynthos. I swear, that tough old goat had a tear in his eye kissing us goodbye, and we weren&#x2019;t far behind. No, this time we wouldn&#x2019;t cry. You could easily get a reputation for it. It was a close call though.</p>","<p>Our very last bit of travelling in Europe was to get the morning ferry over the strait to the dusty old port of Kyllini on the mainland. Last time we did that, it was the beginning of a week-long road trip around the Peloponnese. No such happy beginnings this time. Skirting the coastal road along the southern shoreline of the Gulf of Corinth we drove, reaching the canal by early afternoon, and soon after that the great megapolis of Athens, the once centre of the watery world.</p>","<p>In an area called Hilton that takes its name from the hotel, we threw our baggage down in a small basement apartment and planned our last weekend. We still had some fight left in us. For a start, it was only fitting we should complement our visit in May to the British Museum with a corresponding poke around the new Acropolis Museum. Before we did that, however, there was something more important, as far as I was concerned, for us to visit, hanging in a glass case in a grubbier part of town, up near anarchist-haunted Exarchia and the ill-starred Polytechneio. Something &#x201C;so entirely different and strange that it is nearly impossible,&#x201D; according to the great Richard Feynman.</p>","<p>Now, I&#x2019;ve been to Athens several times and have nice memories of it, for a couple of reasons. The first time I went to Zakynthos, Tina and I stayed in a hotel in the storied Plaka, right in the shadow of the Acropolis, before heading out to Zante. This was back when they used drachmas, before Greece joined the Eurozone and it all started to go a bit funny for them. We went back once with the boys, a few years ago. Our hotel then had a rooftop bar where we drank Mythos and wine looking straight across the rooftop aerials at the lit-up Acropolis. Yes, some nice memories. On the other hand, we were robbed once in Syntagma Square, and I did lose it shamefully with a then four-year-old Alexander in a restaurant in Monastiraki at the end of a long day, but we&#x2019;ve all moved on from those experiences. I&#x2019;ll never forget the electrifying evening atmosphere in Syntagma in the middle of the summer of 2011 when the square was full of indignados, anarchists, and protesters, watched over by a phalanx of nervous riot police up near the Parliament.</p>","<p>But there&#x2019;s no doubt that it&#x2019;s an ugly city, Athens. Victoria Square, which is where a lot of migrants end up sleeping out in the open, is where we alighted from the Metro on our first morning, is not one of its nicer spots. Athens has taught me that one can be fond of a city without finding it remotely attractive.</p>","<p>You expect the usual suspects - statues of beautiful youths and bronzes heads of unknown philosophers - in your typical Greek museum, but the National Archaeological Museum had something else. &#x201C;Something that doesn&#x2019;t fit,&#x201D; in the words of science journalist Jo Marchant. The statue in the courtyard of the leaning youth, half-corroded after two millennia semi-submerged in the mud off the coast of the southern Peloponnese offered a clue. He was crouching forward, head tilted upward in a yearning pose; yearning to be found, and maybe to explain himself and the horde he was found with, especially the mysterious object in the room we were now in that took them so long to make sense of&#x2026;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Alexander, Eoin - know what that is?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Take a good look. That&#x2019;s the Antikythera Mechanism.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>That&#x2019;s</em> the Antikythera Mechanism?&#x201D;</p>","<p>What did they expect? That&#x2019;s the problem with kids these days: we&#x2019;ve given them so much they&#x2019;ve become impossible to impress. That night back in our apartment we watched a documentary about the Mechanism on our laptop. It sank in then, sank in like a marble bust tumbling sixty metres into the sea bed off the island of Antikythera during the storm that suddenly came up and shipwrecked the ill-starred vessel plying its trade between Crete and the mainland two thousand years ago, and they watched in silence. For this was doubly their heritage: half Greek by blood, but, by Jingo, full-blooded digital natives. A clockwork device, one thousand years out of time, found not far from Cape Malea? Had we not swum nearby at Elafonisos last summer at the tip of the index finger? And they knew enough to know that those machines were forerunners of the very items they would soon be spending a half-hour on, if they&#x2019;d been good boys and brushed their teeth, playing games or browsing those wretched memes they loved. A barnacled, crumbling link between the ancient world of Phoenician traders and Homeric sea routes, and the modern one wherein we would tame the stars with our clever inventions, all still based on Euclid and Archimedes, to a degree.</p>","<hr>","<p>An oldish guy stopped on the Metro and delivered an urgent rant at no-one in particular. Presuming it to be about austerity or communism we paid him no heed, but it turned out his urgent polemic concerned pencils. He had four of them, and they were for sale. As far as pencils are concerned - well, I&#x2019;ve kind of moved on. The kids had loads. Maybe I should have helped him, but I didn&#x2019;t. I didn&#x2019;t need any, and sadly for him, neither did anyone else. As suddenly as he had started shouting out his wares he stopped and when the train stopped, he shuffled off with us and everyone else, at Monastiraki, and emerged into the sunlight at the densely-packed block between the ancient Agora and Hadrian&#x2019;s library. We went to check out the flea market.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Hey Dad, can we get this?&#x201D;</p>","<p>Eoin liked the look of a brass looking glass.</p>","<p>&#x201C;How much is it?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know - it doesn&#x2019;t say.&#x201D;</p>","<p>Of course it doesn&#x2019;t say, I thought. We&#x2019;re supposed to talk to the guy, who was already up and alert to the situation, placing his a cigarette on the table and approaching us. He was young, with a fashionable/threatening buzzcut. This is where he&#x2019;s going to try to tangle me up in his net of pseudo-enticements and feints. He probably thought he was talking to any old tourist. Someone unschooled in Hellenic ways. &#x201C;We might have to haggle a bit,&#x201D; I said to Eoin. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s what you do in places like this. Watch and learn, junior.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;<em>Parakalo</em>,&#x201D; I said, knocking a couple of euros off the price just with that one, tactical deployment of a word he never expected someone like me to have. &#x201C;How much is this?&#x201D; I asked, fingering a tenner in readiness.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Eighty euros, my friend.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x20AC;80 for that old thing? What was it? The Antikythera Telescope? I really have no idea about antiques. I just make websites, which nowadays involves few, if any, antique brass objects. I should stay out of these situations. I had just been reminded of why I rarely come to these perplexing places: nothing has a price on it, some things are much cheaper than you&#x2019;d think, some are much dearer, and the difference seems to depend entirely on some arcane historical contingency, of which I, or any reasonable person, could know nothing.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh, right. Thanks.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;You interested?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;No, it&#x2019;s ok. <em>Efharisto</em>.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;You tell me the price, my friend. What price do you want?&#x201D; Even though I was walking away from his stall, he was cleverly walking alongside me regardless. This guy really knew his stuff. Eoin, who got me into this mess, was still back at the guy&#x2019;s stall, eyeing a medal that probably cost thousands. &#x201C;How much, my friend?&#x201D; persisted buzzcut. His haircut was beginning to alarm me. How could I tell him that no matter the intrinsic worth of his telescope it wasn&#x2019;t worth more than around ten euros to me. &#x201C;Really, you tell me. What price are you thinking?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Ten euros?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Bah!&#x201D; He turned around, angry, and went off with a dismissive hand gesture. I&#x2019;m fairly sure I heard the word &#x2018;malaka&#x2019; thrown out for good measure. That&#x2019;s why I don&#x2019;t like this game. If you don&#x2019;t win in the first round, you can only lose. I approached Tina all swivel-eyed and with a conspiratorial air about me. &#x201C;I think we should leave now.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Really? I want to get this <em>vriki</em>. Mum might like it.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Well, get it and let&#x2019;s leave. I&#x2019;m getting the evil eye from your man over there. Can we go to the ancient Agora now? We should be safe. The traders there all died two thousand years ago. Boys!&#x201D;</p>","<hr>","<p>I left Alexander and Eoin in our Hilton flat with some Airfix booty from our boys&#x2019; afternoon visit to the War Museum and joined Tina outside a bar in Kolonaki called &#x2018;Minnie the Moocher&#x2019; for a sundowner. She&#x2019;d spared herself a run through Greece&#x2019;s long and bloody history with us and had gone to the far more sedate Benaki Museum instead. Sandwiched, or should I say, wrapped in a <em>gyros</em>, between Lykavitos Hill and the National Gardens, Kolonaki is a relative leafy, pleasant part of town with plenty of galleries and boutiques. The buzz was good, and the young Athenians were smoking up a storm. </p>","<p>&#x201C;What was the best part of the trip?&#x201D; I asked Tina.</p>","<p>&#x201C;Greece. The first year.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;You would say that.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;What was your best part?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Poland. That was nothing like we thought it would be.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s because we didn&#x2019;t have a clue what it <em>would</em> be like.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;The relief when I got the job in TruePay though&#x2026;that was a real high.

We didn&#x2019;t mind &#x2013; you don&#x2019;t go to a bar in Athens and get upset about cigarette smoke.</p>","<p>&#x201C;The fact that the kids survived two months in the school in Lithaki&#xE1;, then did a full year in Sallynoggin - that&#x2019;s probably the biggest deal of the whole trip.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;And that they got to spend time with their cousins in Clifden,&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;God, I hope we sell the house.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Oh, they&#x2019;re always buying houses down the west.

Hans had reburied him, politely but firmly packing the earth down. <em>&#x2018;Ach, but he was no different from everyone else. He was forced to join the Nazis. Everybody had to join them.&#x2019;</em> &#x201C;We were lucky to have stayed on after that.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;And Adam and his <em>jemkas</em>.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Remember the time we cycled to the beach with him and the kids?&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Course.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;As soon as we got there he set the towels down, and by the time we&#x2019;d gone down to test the water and come back and get changed he was already horizontal and out of it.&#x201D; We were both laughing at the memory of it. &#x201C;Black camino tee, camouflage shorts. Everyone else was in speedos.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;He was definitely one of the heroes of this trip.&#x201D;</p>","<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t forget my Mum.&#x201D;</p>","<p>We could have stayed there all evening, going over the events and the people of the last year and a half, if it wasn&#x2019;t for Alexander and Eoin back at the flat. I think we would have stayed in Europe if it wasn&#x2019;t for them. The clubby music, the half-heard conversations in English and Greek, the sweet cigarette smoke, all made for an ambience we wished we could bottle and take with us.</p>","<hr>","<p>We were old enough to remember the previous Acropolis museum, up top on the hill itself, from that first trip to Athens. There is simply no comparison between that old bunker and what they&#x2019;d built to With it. We spent about two hours in the new Acropolis Museum on our last day. After about ten statues of discus-throwing youths I begin to go a bit fuzzy, but I&#x2019;m glad there are places that have been built to contain them all, and to present them in so overwhelming a space. Although it had little in the way of Antikythera Mechanism-like objects, it did have a &#x2018;Lego Acropolis&#x2019; diorama, donated by The University of Sydney, showing a busy, vibrant, and pristinely white Parthenon in its heyday.</p>","<p>The very last thing we went to, after the Museum, was the Acropolis, and the Parthenon itself. The twilight of the day and of our long trip. I intended to stand where in the spring in 1941 Manolis Glezos and Lakis Santas cut down the Nazi flag, which had been flying over the city for a month. In Europe&#x2019;s darkest hour, the teenagers climbed up the ancient hill in the middle of the night under a strict curfew to carry out their inspirational act of defiance. Although, to be honest, my favourite Acropolis story has to be the one from the War of Independence against the Ottomans. On seeing that the Turks among the ruins had begun to run out of bullets and had started pulling apart anything that looked like it might yield some valuable lead, the Greek fighters, waving a white flag, climbed up and approached their mortal enemies with boxes of bullets, to spare their Acropolis further desecration.</p>","<p>We walked up the sloping street of Dionysiou Arepagitou among the buskers and hawkers and well-heeled locals, and at the bottom of the great hill, stopped in front of a sign that said &#x2018;&#x397; &#x395;&#x3A5;&#x3A1;&#x3A9;&#x3A0;&#x397; &#x391;&#x3A1;&#x3A7;&#x399;&#x396;&#x395;&#x399; &#x395;&#x394;&#x3A9;&#x2019;.</p>","<p>Europe Starts Here.</p>"],["<p>It may seem strange, given the wealth of experiences I&#x2019;ve just described in this book, but the only reason we managed to stay out on the road so long was our bloody-minded thriftiness in the face of the almost constant temptation to spend money to see stuff. Even so, as I write this now I&#x2019;m at a loss as to why, having gone so close to one of the very emblems of Western Civilization, we didn&#x2019;t just pay the pittance it seems now, but didn&#x2019;t then, to see Leonardo da Vinci&#x2019;s <em>The Last Supper</em> while we were on the grounds of Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, in Milan.</p>","<hr>","<p>Oh - we managed to sell the house in Clifden. And after four months I finally finished <em>Il Pendolo di Foucault</em>. It&#x2019;s just a matter of patience.</p>","<hr>","<p>Having benefited so much from Couchsurfing, we signed up as hosts to pay our dues and ended up hosting a couple from England and the Isle of Man, a woman from Guatemala, another from Chile, and a German professional musician and his wife and child - all successful stays, all nice people. And all on big trips just like we&#x2019;d been when we&#x2019;d used others&#x2019; &#x2018;couches&#x2019;.</p>","<hr>","<p>Of course we stayed in touch with Adam and Eva, and on a phone call on the first New Year&#x2019;s Eve after we got back he drunkenly told us we were &#x2018;friends forever&#x2019;. Speaking of Adam&#x2026;throughout the trip I liked to ask people about Greece. Everyone had an opinion, it seemed, so it was a topic that got people talking. Except Adam, who had a joke instead:</p>","<p>A German guy, Hans, arrives on a small Greek island and goes into the first caf&#xE9; he sees to enquire about accommodation. The owner, Nikos, tells him they have a spare room but it&#x2019;s not ready yet; can he come back at six o&#x2019;clock when the caf&#xE9; closes? Hans says fine. Nikos asks for a &#x20AC;20 deposit, which Hans hands over, and Nikos promises to keep the room for him. &#x201C;See you at six. Enjoy the beach!&#x201D; shouts Nikos as Hans walked off.</p>","<p>With Hans out of sight, Nikos walks down to the bakery, orders a frapp&#xE9;, and hands Stefanos the baker the &#x20AC;20 he owes him for the pastries he sells in the caf&#xE9;. &#x201C;<em>Efharisto, Niko mou!</em>&#x201D; Stefanos thanks him. After Nikos has left, Stefanos drives to town and calls into the police station to pay the fine he picked up last week for double parking outside the <em>kafenion</em>. &#x201C;Make sure you don&#x2019;t do it again!&#x201D; the officer chief joked, as the baker handed over the twenty. With the money he just received, the chief took a walk up to the magistrates court to give a judge he knew there a <em>fakelaki</em>, an envelope with &#x20AC;20 in it, that he hoped would help get his complaint about his neighbour seen promptly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll see what I can do.&#x201D; said the judge with a wink. The police chief went off whistling and happy.</p>","<p>As soon as he was finished work, the judge phoned his favourite prostitute, Mimi, and told her to meet him at the usual caf&#xE9;. &#x201C;I have the money I owe you,&#x201D; he explained. When he met her there half an hour later he handed over the &#x20AC;20, and left promptly before anyone noticed him consorting with call girls. Flush now, she in turn took the opportunity to pay the owner of the caf&#xE9; - the one Hans happened to have walked into - for the use of the upstairs room. &#x201C;Thanks, Nikos,&#x201D; she said, handing over the money, just as Hans walked back in. He&#x2019;d come back to speak to Nikos about the room, but when he saw and heard what was going on, he was shocked, shocked! He snatched back the twenty from Nikos&#x2019;s hands, and left in high dudgeon.</p>","<p>And that&#x2019;s how the Greek debt crisis has been playing out, said Adam. The Greeks use German money to pay their debts, but the Germans get to keep it in the end.</p>","<hr>","<p>Even though I&#x2019;ve changed some people&#x2019;s names, the messages that I quote from couchsurfing, for instance the one from Gaby in Potsdam, are all as we got them.
