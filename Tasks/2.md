In the IllustratedBook Blazor project in the IllustratedBook folder, make the project use LESS as a CSS preprocessor. Use the two .less files in the wwwroot to start with and if necesssary, place them in a folder that befits their purpose. Make sure all pages in the project use the new LESS files.

Make a separate less file in the Pages/Index.cshtml file that allows me to separately style that page.

Important: do NOT import any other third-party CSS or style libraries, just use LESS. For layout use CSS Grid and Flexbox.

Don't wait for permission or confirmation before running a command or using a tool.
