Create an image generation service. Place it in services. Use the Replicate keys in appsettings to get the api key, etc. It should take a prompt and return an image.

Inject the chatService into the BookPage component to generate a prompt, using the page's text, then send that prompt to the image service to generate the image.

Place the generated image in the component, showng a loading icon or text while the prompt is being generated. Only do all this when the Generate setting in appSettings is true.
