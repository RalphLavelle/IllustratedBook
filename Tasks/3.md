In the IllustratedBook Blazor project in the IllustratedBook folder, extract the references to DataContext in any blazor components out of those components and put them in the existing book service. When creating a book model, use the title to make a slug, which will be a url-encoded version of the title.

Redo all route links to books, chapters, and pages to use the slug in the url. Have it come between the id and the child id, for instance when linkingto a chapter, use a schema like /books/{bookId}/{bookSlug}/chapters/{chapterId}/{chapterSlug}/pages/{pageIndex}. No need for slugs with pages. 

Don't wait for permission or confirmation before running a command or using a tool.
