THere is an error when generating an image and saving it. The EF classes should not create a new book when saving an image because the book record already exists. Saving an image should not involve saving anything in the Books table, just the Images table. Remove/fix the code that is generating a new book record on saving an image, and link the new image to the eisting book, not a new one.
