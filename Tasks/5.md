Make a chat service that connects to OpenAI using the api key in the settings file. The service will use OpenAI's API to generate a response using this prompt: `Using this text - "${text}", generate a prompt for the Flux Dev model. Ask it to make the image photorealistic, taken from an odd angle, with a high dynamic range, very colourful. The photo should be taken with a Hasselblad H6D-400c medium format camera, using a Carl Zeiss Planar 80mm f/2.8 lens.` The text token in the prompt will be the input for a method that can be called in the service to generate text.
