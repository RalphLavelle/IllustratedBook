In the Blazor project in the IllustratedBook folder, create a new set of Blazor pages and components to allow for a book to be aged through, with page routes corresponding to individual chapters (e.g. '/books/{bookId}/chapters/{chapterId}) and pages (e.g. '/books/{bookId}/chapters/{chapterId}/pages/{pageId}).

Create an example book to test, and put it in the existing Books folder. Link that book from the home page
