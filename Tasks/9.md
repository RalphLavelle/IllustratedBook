Goal: store generated image in the database so that we can reuse them without having to regenerate them from the AI service.

Steps:
* Make a new database table called images, and make the EF migrations for it. It will need to be able to store which book it was generated from, as well as the chapter and page. ALso store the image generation metadata, such as the model used, settings, etc., and the text prompt that was used.
* Pick an encoding mechanism to store the image in the database. If necessary, save the image into a folder instead of directly into the database.
* Check in the BookPage component whether there is a saved image for this chapter's page and if so, use that instead of generating one.
